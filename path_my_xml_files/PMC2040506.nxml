PCR-adjusted adequate clinical and parasitological response, estimated by Kaplan Meier survival and <italic>Per Protocol</italic> analysis, was extremely high for both drugs (99.6&#x00025; for mefloquine-artesunate and 98.4&#x00025; and for dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine) (RR: 0.99, 95&#x00025;CI &#x0005b;0.97&#x02212;1.01&#x0005d;, Fisher Exact p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.21).

If the patient did not report for scheduled visits, every effort was made to locate him/her at the home address. During each visit, a clinical assessment was done and a blood sample for parasitaemia taken by finger prick. At Day 0 and at any visit from Day 7 onwards, a blood spot on filter paper was also taken for later PCR analysis on recurrent parasitemia cases.

Gametocyte carriage rates were estimated as proportion of patients with gametocytemia at day 0, 7, 14, etc, until total clearance in both groups, and person-gametocyte-weeks were calculated to measure gametocyte carriage and transmission potential. The person-gametocyte-weeks rates were calculated as the number of weeks in which blood slides were positive for gametocytes during the 2 first weeks of follow-up after treatment divided by the number of all follow-up weeks and expressed per 1,000 person-weeks. The risk of adverse events during the first week after the start of the treatment was calculated for each group separately in children and adults.

complained of anxiety and insomnia during the whole follow-up period and needed the administration of sedatives and anxiolytic drugs. Serious drug-related adverse events requiring early treatment termination occurred in 3 patients treated with MAS3. A 30 years old man suddenly presented at day 4 with severe dizziness, loss of balance, unsteadiness, amnesia and severe anxiety. Immediately after the end of the treatment, he reported severe headache and insomnia. Clinical and biological examinations diagnosed a toxic metabolic encephalopathy, possibly due to MAS3. A 41 years old man had severe weakness, anxiety, and transient arrhythmia 30 minutes after the second dose of MAS3. The third patient, a 6 years old boy, presented with palpitations and chest pain, 12 hours after the second dose of MAS3.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This first clinical trial carried out in South America on DHA-PPQ showed that this new fixed-dose ACT is as efficacious as MAS3 but better tolerated and with significantly less adverse events. These excellent results strongly support DHA-PPQ as a good alternative to MAS3, the current first line treatment in the Peruvian Amazon region. Moreover, compared to MAS3, DHA-PPQ is less expensive (1.00 USD <italic>versus</italic> 18.65 USD per adult treatment) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001101-Ruebush1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, a major advantage for the Peruvian health authorities that fully subsidise antimalarial treatment. Cure rates at the end of the follow up were extremely high for both treatment groups, regardless of the analysis method, though MAS3 tended to have higher cure rates. Our results are conservative, since we opted for the worst case scenario and considered indeterminate PCR results as recrudescence. In the best case scenario, the 63 day cure rate would have been 100&#x00025; in the MAS3 group. Our results are similar to those reported for DHA-PPQ from Southeast Asia: Thailand (63-day cure rate 96.1&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001101-Ashley1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>), Burma (42-day cure rate 99.4&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001101-Smithuis1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>), Cambodia (28-day cure rate 96.9&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001101-Karunajeewa1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, 63-day cure rate 97.5&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001101-Janssens1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>), Vietnam (56-day cure rate 98.7&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001101-Tran1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>); and from a recent study in Rwanda (28-day cure rate 95.2&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001101-Karema1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>Most patients lost to follow up were forest workers who had to go and work outside the study area. It is impossible to know whether they experienced a recurrent infection within the 63 days after treatment but it is unlikely that all of them had a recrudescence. However, all of them were considered as failures in that ITT analysis, usually recommended in superiority trials to avoid potential bias introduced by patients lost to follow-up <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001101-Altman1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. This is why the ACPR computed by <italic>ITT</italic> analysis is likely to be an underestimation of the true cure rate.</p><p>Though patients in the MAS3 group had a slightly higher prevalence of gametocytemia before treatment, they cleared it more rapidly than patients in the DHA-PPQ group. The latter had a higher person-gametocyte-weeks rate but the difference was not significant compared to MAS3. New gametocytes appeared more frequently during the first week in patients treated with DHA-PPQ than those treated with MAS3, but these small differences were not found significant with the power of our study. As mentioned previously, the lower dose of artemisinin contained in DHA-PPQ as compared to MAS3 may be responsible of these differences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001101-Ashley1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001101-Smithuis1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The incidence of new infections was higher in the DHA-PPQ than in the MAS3 group, possibly reflecting the shorter post-treatment prophylactic effect of piperaquine as compared with mefloquine. It should be noted that all new infections in the DHA-PPQ group occurred at least one month after treatment, from day 35 onwards (most of them, six out of 8, by day 49 or later), while in the MAS3 group the only new infection detected occurred at day 21. However, a similar study (63-day follow up) carried out in Cambodia in a low transmission area and comparing DHA-PPQ with MAS3 did not report any difference in the incidence of new infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001101-Janssens1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The occurrence of adverse events was generally lower and less severe in patients treated with DHA-PPQ than in those treated with MAS3, both in adults and children. Their high occurrence in the MAS3 group differ considerably from that observed in another trial carried out in Peru in 2000 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001101-Marquio1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, in which very few cases of vomiting and insomnia were reported, possibly because of the lower dose of MQ (15 mg/kg) administered. Since our study was not blinded, responder bias cannot be ruled out: patients in the MAS3 group, especially adults, were more likely to report adverse events (especially gastro-intestinal) since some of them may have had previous negative experiences with this antimalarial treatment. Nevertheless, most adverse events observed in our patients are known to occur with MAS3 and their frequency was similar to that reported in previous trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001101-Tran1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001101-Janssens1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Neuro-psychiatric events, such as anxiety and insomnia, were much less frequent in the DHA-PPQ group, and the difference was significant both in adults and children. It is difficult to say whether this is a true difference or due to a responder bias, both for adults and for the children's parents/caretakers. Nevertheless, the type and frequency of adverse events reported is consistent in both age groups and indicate a lower tolerability of MAS3 as compared to DHA-PPQ.</p><p>In conclusion, our study confirmed that DHA-PPQ is a highly effective antimalarial treatment for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria in the Amazon region of Peru. This co-formulation is safe and better tolerated than MAS3 and thus may have a better compliance. All these advantages combined to its low cost makes DHA-PPQ a suitable and even advisable first line treatment for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria in Peru. Our encouraging results should prompt neighbouring endemic countries to conduct similar efficacy trials, and possibly change their anti-malaria treatment policy to this highly efficacious, safe, well tolerated and affordable ACT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001101.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol</p><p>(0.13 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0001101.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001101.s002"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist</p><p>(0.05 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0001101.s002.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all participants in the present trial, all community workers and health staff for their high motivation, patience and their full dedication to the completion of the study.
