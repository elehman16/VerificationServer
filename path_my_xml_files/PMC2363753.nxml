Additionally, the in-patient medical costs of both treatment arms were compared. 40 patients with solid tumours were randomized to receive HD-VIC chemotherapy with or without amifostine (910 mg/m<sup>2</sup> at day 1&#x02013;3) given as a short infusion prior to carboplatin and ifosfamide. Patients were stratified according to pretreatment. HDCT consisted of an 18 h infusion of carboplatin (500 mg/m<sup>2/</sup>d over 18 h), ifosfamide (4 g/m<sup>2</sup>/d over 4 h) and etoposide (500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/d) all given for 3 consecutive days. All patients received prophylactic application of G-CSF (5 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> subcutaneously) to ameliorate neutropenia after treatment. Patients were monitored for nephrotoxicity, gastrointestinal side effects, haematopoietic recovery, as well as frequency of fever and infections. The median fall of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 10&#x00025; from baseline in the amifostine group (105 to 95 ml min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and 37&#x00025; in the control patient group (107 to 67 ml min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c; 0.01). Amifostine-treated patients revealed a less pronounced increase in albumine and low molecular weight protein urinary excretion. Stomatitis grade III/IV occurred in 25&#x00025; without versus 0&#x00025; of patients with amifostine (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01). Acute nausea/vomiting was frequently observed immediately during or after the application of amifostine despite intensive antiemetic prophylaxis consisting of 5-HT<sub>3</sub>-receptor antagonists/dexamethasone/trifluorpromazine. However, delayed emesis occurred more often in the control patients. Engraftment of neutrophil (&#x0003e;&#x02008;500 &#x003bc;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and thrombocytes (&#x0003e;&#x02008;25 000 &#x003bc;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>)were observed at days 9 versus 10 and 10 versus 12, respectively, both slightly in favour of the amifostine arm. In addition, a lower number of days with fever and a shortened duration of hospital stay were observed in the amifostine arm. The reduction of acute toxicity observed in the amifostine arm resulted in 30&#x00025; savings in costs for supportive care (Euro 4396 versus Euro 3153 per patient). Taking into account the drug costs of amifostine, calculation of in-patient treatment costs from the start of chemotherapy to discharge revealed additional costs of Euro 540 per patient in the amifostine arm. This randomized pilot study indicates that both organ and haematotoxicity of HD-VIC chemotherapy can be ameliorated by the use of amifostine. Additionally, a nearly complete preservation of GFR was observed in amifostine-treated patients which may be advantageous if repetitive cycles of HDCT are planned. Larger randomized trials evaluating amifostine cytoprotection during high-dose chemotherapy are warranted. &#x000a9; 2001 Cancer Research Campaign <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.bjcancer.com">http://www.bjcancer.com</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>toxicity</kwd><kwd>high-dose chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>PBSC transplantation</kwd><kwd>cytoprotection</kwd><kwd>amifostine</kwd><kwd>pharmacoeconomics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><back><fn-group><fn id="tlnote1"><p>Presented in part at the 35th Proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, Atlanta, Georgia, USA, May 15&#x02013;18, 1999.
