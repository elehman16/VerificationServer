For young children, however, health risks may develop when the disease lasts longer than 3&#x000a0;days. The purpose of the present trial was to determine whether the stool frequency of infants and toddlers suffering from acute diarrhoea could be normalised more quickly by administering the probiotic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Nissle 1917 (EcN) solution than by administering a placebo. The safety of EcN were also assessed. A total of 113 children (aged 2&#x02013;47&#x000a0;months) with acute diarrhoea (&#x0003e; three watery or loose stools in 24&#x000a0;h) were randomised to either a group receiving the probiotic EcN suspension (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;55) or a group receiving the placebo suspension (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;58) in a confirmative, double-blind clinical trial. Depending on the age of patients, 1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;ml per day of verum suspension (10<sup>8</sup> viable EcN cells per millilitre) or placebo were administered orally. The causes of the diarrhoea were viral rather than bacterial, but they were mainly unspecific infections. The median onset of treatment response (reduction of daily stool frequency to &#x02264; three watery or loose stools over at least 2 consecutive days) occurred more rapidly in the children receiving the EcN solution (2.5&#x000a0;days) than in those receiving the placebo (4.8&#x000a0;days), a significant difference (2.3&#x000a0;days; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0007). The number of patients showing a response was clearly higher (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) in the EcN group (52/55; 94.5%) than in the placebo group (39/58; 67.2%). EcN was found to be safe and well-tolerated, and it showed a significant superiority compared to the placebo in the treatment of acute diarrhoea in infants and toddlers.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00431-007-0419-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Acute diarrhoea</kwd><kwd>EcN</kwd><kwd><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Nissle 1917</kwd><kwd>Infants</kwd><kwd>Probiotic</kwd><kwd>Toddlers</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag 2007</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Probiotics are non-pathogenic microorganisms &#x02013; mostly of human origin &#x02013; which confer health benefits to the host when administered in adequate amounts.

It was carried out in accordance with the requirements of Good Clinical Practice and the Revised Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) of the Federal Agency of Drugs Quality Control, Moscow, Russia, and by the IEC of the State Enterprise Centre of Immunobiological Medicines at the Ministry of Health of Ukraine.</p><p>Acute diarrhoea was defined as more than three watery-to-loose stools per day from an acute episode of non-bloody diarrhoea which did not persist longer than 3 successive days. For reasons of comparability, one of the exclusion criteria was a higher grade of dehydration (loss of body weight &#x0003e;5%; hydration status was surveyed, rehydration was not implemented in low-grade dehydration); the most important inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

Several investigations have been carried out with probiotics for the treatment of acute gastroenteritis, and different meta-analyses and systematic reviews have been published in this field. All of these have demonstrated the efficacy of probiotics in treating or preventing diarrhoea. On average, the treatment of diarrhoea with lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and/or <italic>S. boulardii</italic> shortened the duration of diarrhoea by only 0.5&#x02013;1.5&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Szajewska and Mrukowicz reviewed ten randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies and concluded that the administration of probiotics led to a substantial reduction in the duration of acute diarrhoeal symptoms: an average of 20&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Moreover, a meta-analysis of nine clinical trials conducted by D&#x02019;Souza et al. demonstrated that probiotics effectively prevented antibiotic-associated diarrhoea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The work of van Niel et al. included nine randomised controlled studies with lactobacilli in acute infectious diarrhoea in children. In these studies, the duration of diarrhoea was significantly reduced by an average of 0.7&#x000a0;days along with the stool frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Most recently, McFarland et al. examined the efficacy of probiotics in paediatric diarrhoea by analysing 39 randomised, controlled and blinded clinical trials comprising a total of 41 probiotic treatment arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Of these, 32 (78%) reported efficacy. The latest meta-analysis of 39 trials by Sazawal et al. showed that probiotics prevented acute diarrhea, with a risk reduction among children off 57% (range: 35&#x02013;71%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Diarrhoea is one of the best-studied indications for probiotics, and treatment with EcN has been found to stop acute diarrhoea more rapidly than other probiotics. The efficacy of EcN was confirmed by a second multicentre, prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study conducted by our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In that study, children with prolonged diarrhoea treated with EcN showed a more rapid onset of response to treatment than those treated with placebo (median: 2.4 vs. 5.7&#x000a0;days;<italic> p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001). There was also a remarkable difference in the response rates, as determined on days 14 (EcN: 93.3%; placebo: 65.8%) and 21 (EcN: 98.7%; placebo: 71.1%), thus showing a statistically significant superiority of EcN on both days (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0017 and <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001, respectively).</p><p>In the present trial, high initial response rates in both groups represent the spontaneous healing known for acute gastroenteritis. The superiority of the EcN treatment became increasingly noticeable from 3. The healing process was markedly faster in the EcN-treated patients than in the patients receiving placebo, a result which underlines the high efficacy of this probiotic.</p><p>The relatively high number of children with unspecific diarrhoea corresponds quite well to the frequent failure to detect the responsible pathogen in routine analyses. This is the reason why the results of this study are not helpful in answering the question whether EcN is more efficient in bacterial or viral diarrhea. This question should be addressed by future studies.</p><p>In the present study, EcN was safe and well-tolerated. There was no difference between the EcN and placebo treatments in terms of AEs, body weight, stool examinations and the assessment of tolerance. This result is in accordance with experience from clinical trials in premature and fullterm newborns where EcN was not only very safe but improved the microbial intestinal milieu of the treated infants and reduced the risk of acquiring pathogens early in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It has also been shown that prolonged colonisation with EcN protected infants at an age of 6&#x02013;12&#x000a0;months from flatulence, diarrhoea or constipation when given immediately on the first 5&#x000a0;days after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Our understanding of the effects of probiotics and their numerous modes of action has grown substantially in recent years. With regard to gastroenteritis, probiotics may improve symptoms by several mechanisms, including: 
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>competition with pathogens (for adherence to intestinal epithelium, for growth and survival in the gut) and inhibition of pathogen overgrowth;</p></list-item><list-item><p>secretion of bacteriostatic/bactericidal peptides (e.g. colicins, microcins);</p></list-item><list-item><p>enforcement of intestinal barrier function and reduction of microbial translocation;</p></list-item><list-item><p>modulation of immune responses (local and/or systemic, e.g. stimulation of secretion of IgA by lymphocytes and defensins by enterocytes).</p></list-item></list></p><p>All of these mechanisms of action have been shown for <italic>E. coli</italic> strain Nissle 1917. The antagonistic activity of EcN against pathogens has been demonstrated in vitro in animal models and in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In a pig model of intestinal infection, EcN was able to prevent acute secretory diarrhoea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Among many other strain-specific characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], EcN exerts an intense immunomodulatory effect in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Here, EcN was found to stimulate the production of antibodies of mucosa-associated B lymphocytes and the systemic production of antibodies (IgM, IgA) in premature and fullterm children.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, EcN showed a significant superiority to placebo in the treatment of acute diarrhoea in infants and toddlers.
