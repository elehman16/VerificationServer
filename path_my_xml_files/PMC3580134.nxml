The safety analysis population included all randomized patients who received at least one dose of randomized study medication and from whom any post-randomization data were available. For the subsets of patients who underwent serial spirometry, 24-hour urinary cortisol, BMD, 24-hour Holter monitoring and ophthalmological analyses, analysis sets were defined as those patients who received at least one dose of randomized study medication and had baseline and on-treatment values for the variable being assessed. Patients who discontinued prematurely completed final visit (month 12) assessments at the time of discontinuation, followed by the 4-week follow-up. A sample size of approximately 400 patients per treatment group was calculated to allow 90% power to detect a reduction in the number of COPD exacerbations of approximately 30%, adjusting for overdispersion of 2.3. This sample size ensured &#x0003e;95% power to detect a difference of 0.10L in FEV<sub>1</sub>, given an estimated standard deviation of 0.3 L.

The primary comparisons were prespecified as budesonide/formoterol pMDI 320/9 &#x003bc;g compared with (i) placebo for pre-dose FEV<sub>1</sub> and 1-hour post-dose FEV<sub>1</sub>; and (ii) formoterol DPI 9 &#x003bc;g for pre-dose FEV<sub>1</sub>. If significant differences were obtained, comparisons continued with budesonide/formoterol pMDI 320/9 &#x003bc;g compared with placebo for (i) dyspnoea; (ii) SGRQ total score; and (iii) number of exacerbations. If significant differences were obtained for each of these key secondary variables, the lower dose of budesonide/formoterol pMDI was tested on the co-primary variables, as previously described, and, if significant differences were obtained, testing continued with number of exacerbations, dyspnoea and SGRQ total score compared with placebo. For all secondary efficacy variables, the primary comparison was budesonide/formoterol pMDI versus placebo.</p><p>Primary and secondary variables were assessed as the change from baseline to the average over the randomized treatment period except for average 12-hour FEV<sub>1</sub>, mean FEV<sub>1</sub> at 12 hours and SGRQ at end of treatment. Changes from baseline in the co-primary efficacy variables were analysed via analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA), adjusting for treatment, country and baseline value. The following three key secondary efficacy variables were identified: (i) dyspnoea; (ii) SGRQ total score; and (iii) exacerbations. Secondary variables were analysed similar to the co-primary efficacy variables; however, exacerbation rate (number/patient-treatment year) was analysed using a Poisson regression model, adjusted for country and differential randomization time, and time to first COPD exacerbation was described via Kaplan-Meier plot and analysed using the log-rank test. The number and percentage of patients experiencing clinically meaningful changes (based on a prespecified minimal important difference) in dyspnoea were analysed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, adjusting for country.</p><p>Geometric mean 24-hour urinary cortisol levels at end of treatment were compared between treatment groups using a multiplicative ANCOVA model. Mean changes from baseline to the average during the randomized treatment period in 12-lead ECG, and Holter variables and ophthalmology variables were analysed using a model similar to that used for the co-primary variables. BMD variables (natural logarithm of the analysis timepoint minus the natural logarithm of the respective baseline value for hip and spine) were analysed using an ANCOVA model adjusting for country, treatment and natural logarithm of the baseline value.

In addition, both budesonide/formoterol pMDI dosages were well tolerated relative to formoterol alone and placebo.</p><p>The results of this 12-month study confirm those from the earlier related 6-month study by Tashkin et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and are consistent with those from studies of budesonide/formoterol DPI.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] Taken together, the results demonstrate that this ICS/LABA combination provides benefits beyond formoterol alone in the treatment of COPD. The contribution of budesonide to improvements from baseline in pulmonary function and COPD symptoms was demonstrated by the greater efficacy of budesonide/formoterol 320/9 &#x003bc;g compared with formoterol alone for the co-primary variables of pre-dose FEV<sub>1</sub> and 1-hour post-dose FEV<sub>1</sub>, and for dyspnoea and total BCSS scores, supporting use of the higher-dose combination for COPD symptoms. Both budesonide/formoterol dosage strengths demonstrated greater improvements from baseline compared with formoterol alone in morning and evening PEF, 12-hour FEV<sub>1</sub>, symptom scores and rescue medication use.</p><p>In addition, the 25&#x02013;29% reduction in exacerbation rate observed with both budesonide/formoterol dosage strengths beyond the substantial reduction achieved with formoterol alone further demonstrates the important contribution of budesonide to the combination product. The magnitude of the reduction in exacerbation rates reported in this study is similar to that reported previously for fixed-dose regimens of budesonide/formoterol 320/9 &#x003bc;g twice daily[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and fluticasone propionate/salmeterol[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] relative to LABA alone. A key difference between this 12-month study and the 6-month study of similar design reported by Tashkin et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] is that this study was powered to show a difference in exacerbations, while the 6-month study was not. This study demonstrated a significant reduction in exacerbation rates in patients treated with budesonide/formoterol 320/9 &#x003bc;g and 160/9 &#x003bc;g compared with those receiving formoterol or placebo.</p><p>The fact that a greater percentage of patients in the formoterol and placebo groups who previously received ICS therapy, either alone or in combination, experienced exacerbations compared with those who did not previously receive ICS therapy may result in a skewing of the data; however, a similar response was observed in combination budesonide/formoterol patients with a greater percentage of patients who previously received ICS experiencing exacerbations compared with patients who were not previously treated with ICS therapy. Similarly, a greater percentage of patients who previously received ICS therapy discontinued in the formoterol and placebo groups than those who did not previously receive ICS therapy; however, this trend was reversed in the combination budesonide/formoterol groups.</p><p>The long-term nature of this study allowed for a more thorough assessment of tolerability compared with the 6-month study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] No differences in pneumonia incidence were observed among treatment groups in this study or in the 6-month study, despite a shorter exposure time in the placebo group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] These results contrast with previous COPD studies that showed an increased incidence of pneumonia with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol treatment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] However, in this study and the 6-month study,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] the incidence of potential lung infections other than pneumonia was slightly higher in all active treatments compared with placebo; these differences were largely driven by an increased incidence of bronchitis. The incidence of SAEs, including COPD SAEs, was slightly higher in both budesonide/formoterol groups compared with placebo. This finding may be attributed to the earlier discontinuation in the placebo group, which resulted in a shorter study drug exposure (35 and 29 fewer days vs budesonide/formoterol 320/9 &#x003bc;g and 160/9 &#x003bc;g, respectively). Although the overall incidence of atrial fibrillation, a known LABA class effect, was small (1.1%), an imbalance was noted between the formoterol-containing arms and placebo. However, no differences in new-onset atrial fibrillation were apparent among groups based on 24-hour Holter monitoring or ECG data collected at repeated visits during the randomized treatment period. Overall, the safety profile of budesonide/formoterol pMDI in this 12-month study was similar to that reported in the 6-month study by Tashkin et al.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] suggesting no increase in safety concerns with a longer duration of treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Both dosage strengths of budesonide/formoterol pMDI (320/9 &#x003bc;g and 160/9 &#x003bc;g) were effective and well tolerated over 1 year of treatment in this population of patients with moderate to very severe COPD. In addition, budesonide/formoterol pMDI 320/9 &#x003bc;g demonstrated greater efficacy compared with formoterol for pre-dose FEV<sub>1</sub>, suggesting that the higher dosage strength containing twice the daily dose of budesonide is appropriate in this patient population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="AppESM1"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="SecESM1"><p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data"><media xlink:href="40265_2012_69050549_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Supplementary material, approximately 247 KB.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge Lisa M.
