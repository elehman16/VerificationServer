As the level of available obstetric technology increases, the use of this technology increases as well, leaving researchers to suggest that low-risk women may receive excess interventions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> Intervention rates for low-risk births might be higher than necessary, and there are large variations in inter-unit comparisons.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> In their intrapartum care guidelines, the UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence concluded that if a low-risk woman plans to give birth in a midwife-led unit she will have a higher likelihood of a normal birth with less intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref></p><p>As a counterbalance towards the trend of increased perinatal intervention, low-risk birth units or birth centres have been established. Low-risk birth units can either be freestanding, i.e. localised away from a hospital, or sit alongside, i.e. integrated within a hospital. These units are most often midwife led. Transfer from a low-risk birth unit to a standard care birth unit or hospital is required if medical services are necessary.</p><p>Freestanding birth centres have been studied in different settings, concluding that birth centres are a safe alternative to hospital for low-risk women.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> It is also shown that general practitioners and midwives can identify a low-risk population that can deliver safely at maternity homes, with a low rate of operative deliveries and transfers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> Freestanding, midwife-led birth centres report higher rates of normal births and lower rates of caesarean sections and episiotomies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> Alongside birth units have also been studied widely. The Stockholm birth centre trial concludes that birth centre care is associated with less medical interventions, without statistically significant differences in health outcome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref></p><p>A Cochrane review on the topic concludes that an alternative birth setting versus conventional institutional birth setting is associated with reduced rates of medical interventions and increased maternal satisfaction, but states that there might be an increased risk for perinatal mortality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> According to Gottvall et al.,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> there is no statistically significant difference in perinatal mortality between birth centres and standard care.</p><p>A systematic review on low-risk units concludes that birth centres can offer the possibility of accessible, appropriate and personal maternity care for women and their families, but points to a strong need for randomised trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> Hatem et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> conclude in a Cochrane review that women who had midwife-led care were less likely to experience operative delivery, with no statistically significant differences in fetal or neonatal death overall. Studies reporting results from low-risk units often include participants early in pregnancy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> This implies that a certain number of women included do not fulfil the selection criteria for midwife-led units at onset of labour, and therefore do not attend these units at all in labour. Following the important principle of intention to treat, the participants are still analysed according to the group they were originally allocated to.Waldenstr&#x000f8;m and Nilsson<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> state that among women randomised to the midwife-led unit, 34% were transferred antepartum and 16% were transferred intrapartum.</p><p>In this trial we wanted to study the effect of birth unit on birth outcome for low-risk women, and inclusion was therefore conducted at the onset of spontaneous labour. When searching for similar trials including women at onset of labour conducted in the last 20 years, only two randomised controlled trials were found: one from the USA and one from Hong Kong.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref></p><p>Earlier data from several standard care obstetric departments in Norway show an operative delivery rate (caesareans, vacuum extractions and forceps deliveries) amongst low-risk women of &#x02265;10%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> At freestanding midwife-led units the operative delivery rate for the same group is approximately 5%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref></p><p>The aim of the present randomised controlled trial was to investigate if there were differences in operative delivery rates in low-risk women giving birth in an alongside, midwifery-led unit, compared with obstetric units. We hypothesised that it was possible to reduce the need for operative deliveries, with the same or better results for mother and child, if low-risk women were delivered in a separate low-risk unit.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>In 1999 the Norwegian Parliament decided to organise national birth care into three levels.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Departments of obstetric and gynaecology with more than 1500 births per year, providing all birth care services with obstetricians, paediatricians and anaesthesiologists on duty at all times, and with a neonatal intensive care unit.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Smaller obstetrical departments with 400&#x02013;1500 births per year, providing low-risk birth care with obstetricians and anaesthesiologist on call.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Midwife-led maternity homes with 40&#x02013;400 births per year, providing birth care for healthy women with expected normal births.</p></list-item></list><p>The Norwegian Parliament also advised obstetric departments to have low-risk units within hospitals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> Therefore, the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at &#x000d8;stfold Hospital Trust, with approximately 3000 births per year, was divided into three separate units, placed on separate floors, in 2004: The midwife-led unit (MU), the normal unit (NU) and the special unit (SU).</p><p>The MU is organised for low-risk women with expected normal births who want as little intervention as possible. Restrictive selection criteria must be fulfilled to attend this unit. No epidural is offered nor augmentation, unless required for the second phase of the second stage. If extended surveillance is needed or if the birth needs to be taken over by an obstetrician, the woman will be transferred to either the NU or the SU. Obstetricians are not present at the unit unless called on for a specific reason. The NU is organised for women with expected normal births. The unit has access to extended surveillance, epidural and operative vaginal delivery. It also provides room for women with elective caesareans and inductions after spontaneous rupture of membranes. If extended surveillance is necessary throughout the birth at the NU, a transfer to the SU is not required. The SU is organised for women who are in need of extended surveillance in the antenatal period, during labour and after birth.</p><p>Women expecting normal births may give birth at any of the three units, but at the MU only low-risk women are accepted. The MU has approximately 600 births annually, and the other two units have approximately 1200 births each. Each unit has its own separate staff, and midwives are responsible for all normal deliveries. All units provide both birth and postpartum care.</p><p>To explore our hypothesis a randomised trial was carried out. The primary outcome was operative delivery rates. Secondary outcomes were: augmentation of labour, pain relief, and postpartum haemorrhage, and neonatal outcomes measured by an Apgar score &#x0003c;7 at 5 minutes, metabolic acidosis defined as an umbilical artery pH &#x0003c;7.05 and BE (Base Excess) &#x0003c;&#x02212;12 mmol/l,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> and transfers to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).</p><p>Information about the trial was sent to all women planning to give birth at &#x000d8;stfold Hospital Trust when being called for a routine ultrasound examination. At the routine ultrasound examination at 18&#x02013;20 weeks of gestation, all women roughly suited for the trial received additional written and verbal information about the trial. If eligible for the trial and willing to participate, she was recruited for the trial. If she fulfilled the inclusion criteria at the onset of spontaneous labour, she was randomised to one of the three units.</p><p>The inclusion criteria for this study were similar to the selection criteria at the MU. Healthy, low-risk women without any disease known to influence the pregnancy, one fetus in cephalic presentation, a pre-pregnant body mass index (BMI) &#x02264;32, not smoking more than ten cigarettes per day, no prior operation on the uterus, no prior complicated deliveries, and spontaneous onset of labour between 36<sup>+1</sup> and 41<sup>+6</sup> weeks of gestation. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants.</p><p>All 10 902 women who gave birth at the &#x000d8;stfold Hospital Trust during the study period were given written information on the trial when invited to ultrasound screening at 18 weeks of gestation. As the trial includes only healthy women, a certain number were excluded according to the inclusion criteria. Of the 2884 possible candidates assessed as being both eligible and willing to participate, 1773 did not meet the inclusion criteria by the time of onset of spontaneous labour for the following reasons: no longer considered to be at low risk because of pre-eclampsia, placenta praevia, intrauterine growth retardation, breech presentation, haemorrhage in third trimester, and pre- and post-term pregnancies and inductions (<italic>n</italic> = 697); changed their minds about participating (<italic>n</italic> = 300); the study was paused during summer and Christmas vacations because the MU was closed (<italic>n</italic> = 254); and for other reasons (<italic>n</italic> = 522). This led to a number of 1111 participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flowchart of recruiting and inclusion process.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bjo0118-1357-f1"/></fig><p>The randomisation process was performed through a digital randomisation database developed by the Clinical Research Unit at the University Hospital of North Norway. The midwife who administered the randomisation entered the women's name and checked for eligibility before receiving the randomisation number and unit from the database. Allocation was concealed and the randomisation stratified between primiparous (para 0) and multiparous (para 1+) women (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). As the SU serves women with extended needs, their capacity to receive low-risk women is limited. Because of this, randomisation was pre-specified to allocate 37.5, 37.5 and 25.0% to the NU, MU and SU, respectively.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Some basic characteristics of the participants</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variable</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Midwife-led unit <italic>n</italic> = 282 (%)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Normal unit <italic>n</italic> = 417 (%)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Special unit <italic>n</italic> = 412 (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="4" rowspan="1"><bold>Parity</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nulliparous(P0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">278 (67.5)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">285 (68.3)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">184 (65.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Multiparous(P+)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">134 (32.5)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">132 (31.7)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">98 (35.4)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="4" rowspan="1"><bold>Education</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Primary school</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20 (4.9)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25 (6.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23 (8.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">High school</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">182 (44.2)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">168 (40.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">112 (39.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">College/university</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">202 (49.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">218 (52.3)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">139 (49.3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unknown</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (1.9)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (1.4)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (2.8)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="4" rowspan="1"><bold>Age</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003c;25 years</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">103 (25.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100 (24.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">64 (22.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25&#x02013;35 years</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">263 (63.8)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">270 (64.7)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">181 (64.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;35 years</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">46 (11.2)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">47 (11.3)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37 (13.1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="4" rowspan="1"><bold>Social status</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Married</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">155 (37.6)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">165 (39.6)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">120 (42.6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cohabiting</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">236 (57.3)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">229 (54.9)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">152 (53.9)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Single</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19 (4.6)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20 (4.8)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 (3.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unknown</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (0.5)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (0.7)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (0.4)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec><title>Documentation process</title><p>All data were registered by the midwife in charge in the electronic journal system of the department, <sc>partus</sc> (Clinsoft&#x000ae;), as is routine for all births.

According to the hospital guidelines, dystocia is defined as progression of &#x0003c;1 cm dilatation of the cervix per hour in the active phase of the first stage (defined as 3&#x02013;4 cm dilatation of the cervix and regular contractions until a cervix dilatation of 10 cm). Dystocia in the second stage is recorded if the expulsion phase lasts more than 60 minutes for both nulliparous and multiparous women. Dystocia in the second stage is also recorded if the second stage lasts longer than 2 hours for nulliparous women without epidural or multiparous women with epidural, or more than 3 hours for nulliparous women with epidural or more than 60 minutes for multiparous women without epidural. In the MU dystocia was recorded in 29.1% of the cases, which is a significantly lower rate than 36.9% in the NU (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65&#x02013;0.96) and 40.4% in the SU (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59&#x02013;0.89) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Of all women allocated to the MU, 26.2% were given oxytocin infusion for augmentation of labour, which was significantly lower than 36.7% in the NU (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.59&#x02013;0.89) and 38.0% in the SU (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.56&#x02013;0.86) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Labour dystocia was the main reason for all operative deliveries (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>The mean time for the active phase of the first stage was 4.9, 4.6 and 4.8 hours in the MU, NU and SU, respectively.

Of the 25 women with a haemorrhage of 1000 ml or more, 17 were caused by atonic postpartum haemorrhage (five operative vaginal deliveries, 11 spontaneous deliveries and one caesarean section), three were caused by a retained placenta (two operative vaginal deliveries and one spontaneous delivery) and for five women no indication was stated.</p></sec><sec><title>Neonatal outcomes</title><p>Neonatal outcomes were evaluated by Apgar score &#x0003c;7 at 5 minutes, metabolic acidosis and transfer to NICU within 2 hours of birth.

An umbilical cord pH test was taken in 57.7, 68.8 and 77.3% of the cases in the MU, NU and SU, respectively. Metabolic acidosis was stated in 2.2, 2.8 and 2.0% in the MU, NU and SU, respectively. Transfers to the NICU were conducted in 7.8, 6.2 and 6.7% of the cases in the MU, NU and SU, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>).

Mean dilatation of the cervix was 6.4 cm at the time of transfer; 51% were transferred with a cervix dilatation of &#x0003c;7 cm. Of all women transferred intrapartum, 61 (52.0%) had an operative delivery, and among these, 39.3% were delivered by caesarean section and 60.7% were delivered by operative vaginal delivery.

The results when including 1111 participants showed no statistically significant differences in the total operative delivery rate, nor did it show differences in postpartum haemorrhage or neonatal outcomes between the three units.</p><p>Operative delivery rate is often used as a measure of the quality of birth care,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> but it is a subtle way of measuring quality, as it predicts poor quality if the operative delivery rate is low but gives a negative outcome, or if the rate is high without improving the outcome or even increasing the complications for the mother or newborn, yet it predicts good quality if performed when needed. Finding the right level or percentage of operative delivery will always be a challenge. Operative delivery rates differ between countries and institutions.</p><p>Data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN) from 2008 show an average total operative delivery rate for low-risk women of approximately 13.8%, but varies between institutions. It is worth noting that the birth population in Norway 2006&#x02013;2009 consisted of 42.2% primiparous and 57.9% multiparous women.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> During the study period the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at &#x000d8;stfold Hospital Trust had a high overall operative delivery rate (29.2%) compared with most hospitals in Norway.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> This fact is reflected in the high numbers of caesarean deliveries in this study in all three birth units. The overall high risk of having an operative delivery for low-risk nulliparas with no expressed preferences for level of birth care, leave birth attendants with the challenge of focusing on low-risk primiparous women, guiding them safely through their first labour.</p><p>Statistically significant differences were found for dystocia and augmentation of labour by oxytocin, and the use of epidural and acupuncture as pain relief. Moen et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> studied augmentation for all low-risk women in a retrospective study conducted at a large hospital in Norway. They found that low-risk women were given oxytocin in 39% of the cases (62% of the primiparous and 24% of the multiparous women), many of them without any documented indication. In a debate article in the <italic>BMJ</italic> in 2002, the authors state that medical interventions have become routine in normal childbirth, without evidence of effectiveness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> This view is supported by others.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref></p><p>A strength of this trial is the time for randomisation when comparing intrapartum birth care and birth outcome in low-risk birth units and standard care units. All participants were defined as low risk when entering the trial at onset of spontaneous labour, making sure that only those fulfilling the selection criteria were included. As far as we know no similar trial has been conducted in Europe during the last two decades.</p><p>A possible limitation of this trial is the fact that the number of women included was less than estimated by the power calculations, based on the primary outcome: operative delivery. This also might be the reason for the wide confidence interval for the primary outcome. However, the differences between the three units were so small that even if the total number of participants were included, it is considered unlikely that the differences would be significant. Only small non-significant differences in total operative delivery rate were found (total operative delivery rate, MU versus SU <italic>P</italic>= 0.57 and MU versus SU <italic>P</italic>= 0.44). There is a challenge in recruiting participants to studies like this because of the fact that women today often have their own preference for place of birth.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> This fact led to a longer recruiting period than expected in this trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Conclusion</title><p>The operative delivery rate, the risk of having a postpartum haemorrhage of more than 1000 ml and the outcome for the newborn were not affected by the level of care for low-risk women without prelabour preferences for level of care. The participants randomised to the MU had a significantly higher chance of giving birth without interventions like augmentation by oxytocin or epidural analgesia. Further research is needed to determine the influence of women's own preference for birth care unit.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank all of the women who participated in this trial, all the midwives at the MU, NU and SU who have contributed to this trial in a professional way, and the midwives who informed and recruited participants.
