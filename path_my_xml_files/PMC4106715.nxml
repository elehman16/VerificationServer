This randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial (N=301 smokers) tested 200 and 400 &#x000b5;g doses administered 4 or 5 times over 6 months compared to placebo. 3&#x02019;AmNic-rEPA recipients with the highest serum anti-nicotine antibody response (top 30% by AUC) were significantly more likely to attain 8 weeks continuous abstinence from weeks 19 through 26 than the placebo recipients (24.6% vs. 12.0%, p=0.024, OR=2.69, 95% CI, 1.14&#x02013;6.37). The 5 injection 400 &#x000b5;g dose regimen had the greatest antibody response and had significantly higher abstinence rates than placebo.

The global rate of smoking and smoking related deaths is anticipated to increase over the next 20 years unless significant public health measures are instituted. These include effective cessation interventions such as pharmacological treatments, which improve cessation rates by 1.5 to 3 fold over placebo intervention [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Approved pharmacotherapies (e.g., nicotine replacements, bupropion SR, varenicline) for smoking cessation act on the central nervous system, each with a different mechanism of action. Other novel medications are being developed including immunotherapeutics targeting nicotine.</p><p id="P3">Nicotine conjugate vaccines stimulate the immune system to develop nicotine specific antibodies (Abs) using an immunogen comprised of nicotine covalently linked to a larger carrier protein. Conceptually, the mechanism of action is that anti-nicotine antibodies bind nicotine molecules and the resulting complex is too large to cross the blood-brain barrier. With increasing Ab levels more nicotine is captured and sequestered in the blood and prevented from entering the brain, leading to less reinforcing effects from nicotine. Animal studies have demonstrated that passive or active immunization results in approximately 30% to 90% less nicotine entering the brain compared to control rats [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and attenuated locomotor [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and behavioral [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] responses to nicotine.

Similarly, in a separate study conducted by Cornuz and coworkers [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] testing a different nicotine vaccine (nicotine derivative conjugated to a virus-like particle derived from bacteriophage Q&#x003b2;), <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis showed subjects stratified to the highest Ab group had a significantly higher quit rate than placebo. However, unlike the current study, which used the intent-to-treat (ITT) population to establish proof of concept, the reported finding by Cornuz et al.

Although no direct comparisons can be made, these odds ratios are not unlike ones observed in the meta-analyses conducted for the U.S. Clinical Practice Guideline where the reported odds-ratios ranged from 1.5 (95% CI 1.2&#x02013;1.7) for nicotine gum to 3.1 (95% CI 2.5&#x02013;3.8) for varenicline at 6 months post-quit [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. If current study findings are confirmed in larger studies, imunotherapeutics are likely to emerge as an important aid to smoking cessation.</p><p id="P23">No significant compensatory smoking in response to the presence of anti-nicotine antibodies, as determined by the number of cigarettes smoked per day, carbon monoxide levels or cotinine levels, was observed in this study. This result is consistent with observations from other studies [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the current study, subjects in the high Ab group who did not abstain smoked significantly lower number of cigarettes (median reduction of ~5 cigarettes/day) and experienced lower cotinine levels (~20%) than placebo subjects along with no differences observed between the low Ab and placebo groups. However, a small number of individual subjects (N=15/301) smoked more than 2-fold the number of cigarettes at baseline with no significant differences between the active treatment and placebo groups.</p><p id="P24">A major challenge for immunotherapeutics is to stimulate high Ab levels in the vast majority of smokers trying to quit. Vaccine dose and frequency of vaccination have an impact on the Ab levels attained. The 5 injection/400 &#x000b5;g dose was associated with the highest Ab response, although not statistically significant, possibly due to the small sample size. Importantly, this dose and schedule demonstrated statistically significant improved 44-week CAR compared to placebo. Because the 4 injection/400 &#x000b5;g dose was not associated with higher abstinence rates, this result demonstrates that consideration of both dose and schedule of injection are critical. In an independent, follow-up immunogenicity study to examine if peak Ab levels could be elevated, a total of 74 subjects received 6 injections of 400 &#x000b5;g 3&#x02019;AmNic-rEPA at week 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 26. More than 80% of subjects receiving the 6-dose immunization regimen exceeded a target level of Ab (25 &#x000b5;g/ml) by week 14. In contrast, only 50% of subjects receiving 5 injections of the 400 &#x000b5;g dose achieved this level by week 14 in the current study and, only 7% of subjects attained this level by the target quit date. This finding suggests that more frequent injections and a later quit date may increase treatment success.</p><p id="P25">In general, 3&#x02019;AmNic-rEPA was well-tolerated. The frequencies of local and systemic vaccine reactogenicity events were similar in the vaccine and placebo groups and similar to licensed adult vaccines containing Alum adjuvant [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The slight increase in cases of <italic>herpes zoster</italic> observed in this study may be spurious, but continued monitoring is necessary to determine if a causal relationship exists. The occurrence of a single anaphylactic reaction would suggest a need for continued monitoring and follow-up, even considering the subjects&#x02019; history of prior drug allergy to penicillin.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">1</xref></sup></p><p id="P26">In summary, results from this study support the concept that high anti-nicotine Ab levels are associated with higher rates of abstinence. These findings suggest that vaccines attaining high Ab levels by the target quit date may be more effective. Other future strategies may include examining additional ways to increase Ab levels across all individuals. Nonetheless, this study demonstrates that 3&#x02019;AmNic-rEPA has significant potential as a smoking cessation, and perhaps a relapse prevention aid.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S14"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S15"><title>Study Population</title><p id="P27">Smokers were recruited via advertisement across nine geographically diverse U.S. sites. Interested subjects were screened over the telephone and more extensively screened at the first Screening Visit. Subject informed consent was obtained prior to screening. Subjects were 18 years of age or older, smoked &#x02265;15 cigarettes/day, had exhaled CO &#x02265;10 ppm; wanted to quit smoking, and were in good general physical and mental health. Exclusion criteria included recent use of any medications or drugs that might interfere with immune response, interact with the vaccine, and pharmacotherapies or other treatments for smoking cessation. For females, a negative urine pregnancy test at enrollment and active use of acceptable birth control or documentation of surgical sterility was required.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Study Design</title><p id="P28">This Phase 2 study was a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm trial design (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Four treatment groups varied the dose and/or schedule of intramuscular vaccination: 200 or 400 &#x000b5;g of 3&#x02019;AmNic-rEPA or placebo according to Schedule 1 (weeks 0, 6, 12, and 26) or Schedule 2 (weeks 0, 4, 8, 16, and 26). Subjects (N=150) were first randomized within Schedule 1 groups in a 1:1:1 ratio (200 &#x000b5;g: 400 &#x000b5;g: placebo) and then 151 subjects randomized within Schedule 2 groups in the same ratio. The TQD was 1 week after the second injection (end of week 7 for Schedule 1 and end of week 5 for Schedule 2). If the subjects relapsed (seven consecutive days of smoking) after the quit date, a second quit date coinciding with a future clinic visit was allowed between time of relapse and week 18. Cessation counseling (based on the USDHHS Clinical Practice Guidelines [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]) for the first quit attempt involved 5 standardized face-to-face sessions (&#x02264;10 minutes) and for the second quit attempt, a face-to-face session plus 2 post-quit telephone counseling sessions.</p><p id="P29">Subjects were followed for 52 weeks after randomization and the first injection on Day 0 for a total of 21 visits. During the injection day, subjects remained at the study site for 30 to 60 minutes for observation and attended a visit 24 hours after each injection to assess side effects. Otherwise, visits ranged from weekly to bi-weekly and were less frequent after later injections.</p><p id="P30">Subjects who failed to quit smoking on their TQDs were encouraged to remain in the study and continue to attempt to achieve abstinence. Subjects who terminated from the study were not replaced and presumed to be smokers.</p><p id="P31">Institutional Review Board approval was obtained from all institutions involved in the study. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) met four times during the study.</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Investigational Product</title><p id="P32">The active investigational product was purified 3&#x02019;-aminomethylnicotine conjugated to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> r-exoprotein A. For the 200 and 400 &#x000b5;g/mL dose, each single-use syringe contained 3&#x02019;-aminomethylnicotine conjugated to 200 or 400 &#x000b5;g rEPA, respectively, adsorbed to 1.2 mg aluminum hydroxide adjuvant (Alhydrogel 85) in 1 mL phosphate buffered saline (0.15 M NaCl, 0.002 M NaPO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.2, 0.01% polysorbate 80; PBS). For the placebo dose, PBS with 1.2 mg Alhydrogel 85 was included in a 1 mL single-use syringe.</p></sec><sec id="S18"><title>Measures</title><p id="P33">Cigarette use was recorded daily on an electronic diary for 182 days, and then weekly for the remainder of the study. Exhaled CO and urine cotinine were measured at each study visit, except for visits within 24 hours of vaccination. Questionnaires were collected via electronic diary: Fagerstr&#x000f6;m Test for Nicotine Dependence [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] (administered days 0, 210, 364), Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale [MNWS, 19] (administered weekly until Month 6) and data on other tobacco usage.</p><p id="P34">Sera were collected for immunogenicity measurements at 16&#x02013;17 time points (schedule-dependent) from baseline to week 52. Anti-nicotine antibody concentrations were measured using ELISA (Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay) [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Subjects recorded standard local and systemic reactogenicity events for 7 days after each injection. All reactogenicity events were followed until resolution or study completion. Treatment emergent AEs were recorded until 4 weeks after the last dose, with the exception of SAEs, which were collected through week 52. Subjects were also periodically monitored at clinic visits for vital signs, weight, hematology, chemistry and urinalysis.</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="P35">The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population was used for evaluation of efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. The ITT population was defined as all subjects who were randomized to treatment.</p><p id="P36">The primary endpoint was continuous smoking abstinence for a total of 8 weeks measured from the beginning of week 19 to the end of week 26 (determined from subject diaries confirmed by exhaled CO &#x02264;8 ppm). The analysis for proof-of-concept stratified the active-treatment recipients into high (top 30% AUC from weeks 0 to 26) and low (bottom 70% AUC from weeks 0 to 26) Ab responders, regardless of treatment group. An a priori decision was made to establish the antibody cutoff between 50% and 25%. Top 30% by AUC group was selected as the largest group of high antibody responders between the 25% and 50% cutoffs that demonstrated statistical significance as compared to placebo. Smoking outcomes were compared between subjects with high Ab and pooled placebo recipients using logistic regression.</p><p id="P37">Secondary aims of this study were to assess a) 7-day point prevalence abstinence at various times, CARs during 52 weeks and time to sustained abstinence defined as attaining 8 weeks of continuous abstinence at anytime prior to week 46 <italic>and</italic> maintaining continuous abstinence through 52 weeks; b) impact on compensatory smoking amongst non-abstainers; c) withdrawal symptoms and d) immunogenicity, efficacy and safety of administration of either 4 or 5 of the 200 and 400 &#x000b5;g doses.</p><p id="P38">Secondary smoking cessation analyses used logistic regression for binary outcomes and Cox proportional hazards regression models and log-rank tests for time-to-sustained abstinence analyses. Mixed-effects repeated-measures analyses of the number of cigarettes smoked, CO and cotinine adjusted for baseline were utilized in assessing compensatory smoking among non-abstainers or in assessing withdrawal symptoms.</p><p id="P39">Anti-nicotine Ab responses were summarized as GMC with 95% confidence intervals. Safety was assessed throughout this study primarily using reactogenicity and adverse events (AEs). Reactogenicity data for 7 days after each injection were tabulated, and the proportions of subjects with any post-vaccination reactogenicity, aggregated over all injections, among the five treatment groups were compared using the Generalized Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.</p><p id="P40">When a subject dropped out of the study, they were assigned presumed to be smokers. Otherwise, all missing diary data related to cigarette use were imputed utilizing the Last Observation Carried Forward principle. No imputation was carried out for CO level. The missing serology data were imputed by first defining a set of injection windows for each schedule. The missing serology was imputed by using the next available measured serology in its corresponding window; if the next value was not available the value of the nearest previous time point in that window was used. The AUC for anti-nicotine Ab was calculated based on imputed data. For Ab values one week after the target quit date, the value at week 9 was used for Schedule 1 as sera were not collected at week 8.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN1"><label>1</label><p id="P41">In subsequent completed and on-going clinical studies comparing 3&#x02019;-AmNic-rEPA and placebo, over 1800 subjects have received 1&#x02013;6 vaccinations with 400 &#x000b5;g 3&#x02019;AmNic-rEPA or placebo.
