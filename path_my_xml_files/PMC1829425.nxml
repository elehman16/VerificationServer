Tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref> Although advances in high-intensity, clinic-based interventions have yielded moderate to high abstinence rates, such treatments reach few smokers. To reach a larger spectrum of smokers, effective low-intensity interventions are needed.</p><p>The Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guideline on Tobacco Use and Dependence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref> acknowledges the unique role health care providers play in promoting smoking cessation efforts by a large number of smokers in the community. The Guideline recommends that in every visit, physicians perform 5As: <italic>ask</italic> about smoking status; <italic>advise</italic> smokers to quit; <italic>assess</italic> readiness to quit; <italic>assist</italic> in quitting; and <italic>arrange</italic> follow-up. Over 70% of smokers see a physician annually,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref> making the medical visit a critical &#x0201c;teachable moment&#x0201d; for delivery of smoking cessation messages. Even brief interventions delivered by primary care physicians have been shown to increase cessation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></p><p>Despite the potential impact, data indicate that few smokers are offered smoking cessation assistance during routine medical visits.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref> A medical chart review study revealed that only 21% of physicians provided smoking cessation counseling, and only 1.3% regularly recommended nicotine replacement therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref> Patient reports also yield a low rate of physician delivery of smoking cessation services. One statewide survey documented that 51% of smokers were asked about smoking; 45.5% were advised to quit; 14.9% were offered assistance to quit; and 3% were scheduled for smoking-related follow-up.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref> Incorporating smoking cessation counseling into medical practice remains a challenge.</p><p>Technology offers another promising approach that has the potential to extend the reach of interventions that could otherwise only be offered by experienced clinicians. An expert system is a computer program that implements decisional algorithms similar to those an experienced clinician might practice. A system based on the stage-of-readiness framework evaluates an individual&#x02019;s smoking history and provides a personalized feedback report with counseling messages tailored to the smoker&#x02019;s readiness for change. Results from several studies indicate that providing smokers with a personalized, stage-based report enhances cessation rates.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></p><p>In the current study, we tested an intervention that integrates a brief, tailored expert-system report with face-to-face physician-delivered counseling in a primary care setting. Based on patients&#x02019; assessment responses, a tailored report was generated and distributed to physicians and their patients who smoke. The current intervention was innovative in several ways. Unlike previous computer-tailored interventions that were directed toward patients only, the current intervention targeted both patients and physicians in &#x0201c;real time&#x0201d; during the medical visit. Also, to maximize its use in the time-strapped primary care environment, the tailored report was considerably shorter than the previously tested versions. The intervention had two objectives: (1) to bolster the rate at which physicians delivered smoking cessation services and (2) to increase patients&#x02019; quit rates. Providing both the smoker and his/her physician with a report at the time of the health care visit was expected to cue physicians to deliver smoking cessation counseling as well as activate patients to elicit such counseling. In addition to its cuing function, the report was intended to compensate for limitations in physician time and knowledge of counseling techniques, thus bolstering treatment capacity. We hypothesized that the intervention would surpass usual care on physician implementation of the 5As, quit rate, length of quit attempts, number of quit attempts, and stage-of-change progression.</p><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study Design and Recruitment</title><p>A randomized controlled trial was conducted to examine the effectiveness of a tailored smoking cessation intervention directed toward physicians and patients during a routine office visit. In partnership with a leading New York City (NYC)-managed care organization, we identified potentially eligible physicians in the four largest metropolitan boroughs, Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens. The boroughs were divided into different geographic areas, and physicians were sampled from each area to ensure geographic representation.</p><p>The study was approved by the institutional review board. All participants underwent an informed consent process. Physician recruitment was initiated via facsimile invitation followed by telephone calls from a physician recruiter. Physicians who consented to participate were contacted by the study director and screened for eligibility. Eligibility criteria included internal or family medicine specialty, plans to continue practicing in current location for at least 1&#x000a0;year, at least 75 patient visits per week, primarily English-speaking patients, and fewer than 25% geriatric patients. All physicians were paid $150. Physicians in the intervention condition received an additional $50 in recognition of greater time commitments expected of them. A random number generator was used to assign physicians to intervention or usual care control. Physicians learned their group assignment after signing the informed consent. Physician recruitment occurred between September 2002 and May 2004. Of the total 579 physicians contacted by facsimile, 70 were successfully recruited and completed the study (see flowchart, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

All identified smokers were offered the opportunity to participate. Study staff continued to recruit at each physician office for up to 10&#x000a0;days or until 10 smokers were enrolled, whichever came first. Initial assessment was completed immediately before the patient&#x02019;s appointment and included information necessary to generate the report. The second assessment occurred immediately after the medical visit and contained questions regarding the physician&#x02019;s 5A performance. Patients in the usual care condition completed the same assessments but did not receive the report. Patients were contacted 6&#x000a0;months after the initial enrollment for a telephone follow-up interview to assess outcomes. Self-reported abstinence was biochemically validated with the use of a saliva&#x02013;cotinine test.</p><p>Smokers were paid $20 for completing initial assessments and $10 for the follow-up interview. To be eligible, smokers were required to be at least 18&#x000a0;years old, to have smoked in the past 7&#x000a0;days, and to have smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime. Participants were also required to be English-speaking and to plan to retain their physician for the next 12&#x000a0;months. Of the total 5,826 smokers and nonsmokers screened, 580 met eligibility criteria and agreed to participate. Sixty-two were withdrawn due to computer malfunction, scheduling, or time constraint. A total of 518 smokers completed initial assessments; 465 completed the 6-month assessment (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Initial Patient Assessment</title><p>Several measures were used to tailor the expert-system report.

The Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref> was used to measure dependence level. The Pros and Cons Scale was used to identify perceived positive and negative features associated with smoking.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref> The Self-Efficacy Scale identified main temptations to smoke and measured patients&#x02019; confidence to not smoke in specific situations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref> Additional information used to tailor the report included smoking quantity and duration, past quit attempt duration, and existing medical conditions exacerbated by smoking.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Smoking Cessation Expert-System Intervention</title><p>A health educator provided individual physician training in brief smoking cessation counseling based on the 5As Clinical Practice Guideline. The training was conducted during a 40-minute visit to the physician&#x02019;s office and followed an &#x0201c;academic detailing&#x0201d; approach.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref> The educator explained the use of the report and encouraged physicians to review it with each patient enrolled in the study.

To minimize time burden and maximize user friendliness, the patient assessment lasted for 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;minutes, and the report was one page. Patients entered their information directly into a laptop computer with minimal assistance from research staff. Two copies of the report were automatically printed upon assessment completion. Research staff gave one copy to the patient. They handed the other (physician report) to the office staff who placed it in the patient&#x02019;s chart for physician review before and/or during the appointment.

Our primary finding is that physicians who received the intervention were more likely to perform the 5As. Specifically, the intervention increased the rate at which physicians advised patients to quit, and more than doubled the rate at which they assessed readiness to quit, assisted in quitting, and arranged follow-up. All &#x0201c;assist&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;arrange&#x0201d; activities, those that have been shown to be most problematic in terms of physician adherence,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref> were significantly increased by the intervention.</p><p>Despite the large intervention effect on physician 5A performance, 6-month smoking cessation rates were only modestly higher among patients who received the intervention, an effect that approached but did not reach statistical significance. The intervention did result in longer quit attempts, one of the strongest determinants of cessation success,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref> and greater stage-of-change forward movement, which have been associated with enhanced quit attempts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref> The 12% quit rate observed among intervention patients is consistent with quit rates achieved by other interventions in primary care settings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref> However, the control group cessation rate (8%) was higher than that predicted by secular trends,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref> resulting in a small between-group difference and treatment effect. One factor that may have contributed to the relatively high control-group quit rate is that smokers in the control condition were exposed to an active treatment ingredient. Namely, as part of the assessment, patients were asked about their smoking status and assessed for readiness to quit, which are two of the 5As. The assessment may have sensitized smokers in the control group to consider quitting smoking.</p><p>Another possible reason for the small cessation effect is the less than anticipated sample size and consequent reduction in statistical power to detect group differences. The average patient caseload per physician was lower than that expected on the basis of focus groups conducted before study commencement. In addition, the proportion of patients identified as smokers (15%) was significantly less than the expected 20&#x02013;30% found in other primary care studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref> and less than the estimated 25% smoking prevalence in NYC when the study was designed. Thus, we did not attain our intended enrollment target. The low smoking base rate in the current study may reflect the 11% smoking prevalence decline observed in NYC, presumably attributable to comprehensive citywide tobacco control measures that were implemented concurrently.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></p><p>An important limitation of this study is that a minority of the physicians contacted to participate were enrolled because a large proportion refused participation or could not be reached. Although demographic information on nonparticipators is not available, physicians in the current study may be a highly select group.</p><p>Even though the intervention had only a modest effect on smoking behaviors, the innovative integration of computer technology during routine medical visits was highly effective in enhancing 5A adherence. In its impact on physicians&#x02019; behavior, the current intervention compares favorably to other primary care interventions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref> For instance, it produced more comprehensive improvements in 5A performance than interventions that featured a vital sign stamp<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref> or a smoking assessment questionnaire only.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref> It also produced greater gains in &#x0201c;Advise&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Assist&#x0201d; compared to a significantly more intensive, five-component intervention that included a physician tutorial, vital sign stamp, physician performance feedback, nicotine replacement therapy, and telephone counseling.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref> Smoking outcomes with the current intervention were also comparable to an intervention consisting of training physicians in brief cessation counseling.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref> Cessation rates surpassed those of an intervention consisting of a 2-hour tutorial plus prompt.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref> Because 70% of U.S. smokers visit their physician annually, even modest cessation rates can translate into significant public health benefit. Although other public health approaches, such as telephone quitlines, are available, physician advice and referral are important to maximize use of these resources.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></p><p>Another important aspect of this intervention is the minimal time burden and staff resources needed for implementation. Intervention physicians spent an average of 3.8&#x000a0;minutes discussing smoking. Minimal burden increases the likelihood of integration into a busy clinical practice. The main requirements for integration are availability of a patient-accessible computer with printer and encouragement of all smokers to complete the assessment before their physician visit. Incorporating computer-tailored programs into routine medical practice can be challenging. The current intervention addressed some previously identified barriers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref> by streamlining administration time and directly targeting patients who were current smokers. Research staff recruited patients into the current study. Although this practice helped to reduce demand on office staff, it diminished the number of smokers that could be reached and the possibility of readministering the intervention to returning smokers, both of which may enhance intervention impact. A manuscript describing cost effectiveness of the intervention is currently under review.</p><p>The current study shows that a brief computer-tailored intervention can significantly increase primary care physicians&#x02019; implementation of the 5As and result in modest effects on smoking outcomes. This intervention holds promise in reaching the main objective of the Smoking Cessation Clinical Practice Guideline: to intervene with all smokers who visit their physician. Increased rates of guideline implementation can potentially have an enormous public health impact. Further research is needed to increase the potency of the intervention with regard to quit rates and to determine how best to integrate it into outpatient health care settings.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The authors thank and acknowledge Shannon Erisman and Quinne Leyden for their contributions in data collection.</p><p><bold>Potential Financial Conflicts of Interest</bold> None disclosed.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</collab></person-group><article-title>Annual smoking&#x02014;attributable mortality, years of potential life lost, and productivity losses&#x02014;United States, 1997&#x02013;2001</article-title><source>MWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep</source><year>2005</year><volume>54</volume><fpage>625</fpage><lpage>628</lpage></citation><citation citation-type="display-unstructured">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
