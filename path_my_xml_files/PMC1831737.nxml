However, this proportion has been declining slowly in recent years, and the same trend has also been seen in a few other African countries. It is not clear whether these trends are related to changes in the way people behave, perhaps as a result of public health and prevention campaigns, or rather are due to changes in the natural spread of the HIV epidemic. However, there is considerable uncertainty about how we should carry out campaigns that try to get people to change their behavior. One possible approach for achieving behavior change involves peer education: that is, education carried out within the community, by at-risk community members themselves. Another approach involves tying together a set of related programs that deliver information and education through health clinics and directly in the community. Such programs are termed &#x0201c;integrated community and clinic-based HIV prevention.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>The researchers wanted to find out whether providing integrated community and clinic-based strategies for HIV prevention in Eastern Zimbabwe could reduce the proportion of people within the community infected with HIV. If successful, then the strategies could be effective elsewhere, for example in other African countries where behavior patterns and the HIV epidemic are similar to the situation studied here.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The research was done as a cluster-randomized trial. This means that different communities were assigned by chance to one of two trial arms, either an &#x0201c;intervention arm&#x0201d;, where the community and clinic-based strategies would be delivered, or a &#x0201c;control&#x0201d; arm which would not have additional services. Six pairs of communities in Eastern Zimbabwe were compared, each of which had its own health center. Control communities received the standard government services for preventing HIV. The other communities received a package of various additional strategies. These included education and condom distribution amongst sex workers and their clients; better services at sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics (STIs can increase the risk of HIV infection); and educational HIV/AIDS open days at health centers. The researchers planned to compare, between the two arms, the number of people who became infected with HIV over the course of the trial. They found that there was no statistical difference in the number of people in the intervention arm who became infected with HIV over the course of the trial, as compared to people in the control arm. Men in the intervention communities were more likely to have effective treatment for STIs, but women were more likely to show risky behaviors, such as having sex at a younger age, and having unprotected sex. However, men in the intervention communities were more knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS than men in the control communities. One strategy in the intervention arm (delivery of education and condom distribution among sex workers and their clients) may have been less successful because of the economic situation at the time, which meant that the income-generating projects that were supposed to support this initiative were impossible.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>Some of the results from this trial are encouraging, for example an improvement in male participants' knowledge and behavior. However, overall, the intervention did not have an impact on the HIV infection rate in the community. Some other trials have also shown similar results. These results mean that other strategies need to be developed, and tested, which will encourage people to change their behavior patterns and reduce the risk of getting HIV. However, trials such as this are very difficult to design, carry out, and interpret. In particular, if a complex intervention such as this fails, it is often hard to tell whether it did so because the intervention was not delivered successfully, or because it did not work.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040102">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040102</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Information from Avert, an international HIV/AIDS charity, on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.avert.org/aids-zimbabwe.htm">HIV and AIDS in Zimbabwe</ext-link>

Each community included at least one Government or Mission health centre. It was anticipated that HIV-1 incidence would be similar within each pair of communities. Within each pair, one community was assigned at random (un-blinded coin toss by a Ministry of Health official witnessed by programme and research personnel) to receive the additional intervention and the other to be the control. These procedures were designed to ensure that Mission, non-governmental organisation, and private sector programmes (for details, please refer to the following section) would be distributed evenly between intervention and control sites.</p><fig id="pmed-0040102-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Location of Intervention and Control Communities in Manicaland Province, Eastern Zimbabwe</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pmed.0040102.g001"/></fig><p>We assessed the effect of the intervention using results from laboratory tests for HIV-1 infection and questionnaire data collected in the baseline and 3-y follow-up rounds of a population-based, closed-cohort survey. The 12 study communities were enumerated in a phased manner, with paired communities being enumerated consecutively to minimise the effects of any seasonal factors. HIV-1&#x02013;prevention activities were commenced in each intervention community shortly after completion of the baseline survey in that community. In each community, individuals eligible for the study were identified in the first round using data from household listings prepared in an initial census. All males and females aged 17&#x02013;54 y and 15&#x02013;44 y at last birthday (the age groups expected to have the highest incidence of HIV infection), respectively, who had slept in a household in the community for at least four nights in the previous month, and who had also done so at the same time 1 y earlier, were considered eligible for the study. In heterosexually driven HIV-1 epidemics, risk of infection can be correlated amongst marital partners [<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, to maximise statistical power to detect differences in HIV-1 incidence, enrolment was restricted to one randomly selected member per marital group.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Interventions</title><p>Intervention and control communities were to receive standard Government services including basic syndromic STI management, condom distribution from health clinics and Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council outlets, home-based care, and limited HIV/AIDS&#x02013;focussed IEC activities (e.g., occasional AIDS-awareness meetings and distribution of posters and leaflets). In addition, social marketing of male and female condoms would be provided through an ongoing national programme [<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The intervention comprised targeted and population-level strategies to promote safer sexual behaviour and to improve treatment of STIs that facilitate HIV-1 transmission. The intervention strategies were implemented by two local non-governmental organisations (Family AIDS Caring Trust and the Biomedical Research and Training Institute) and the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Welfare through an integrated programme of community- and clinic-based activities. Integration of the individual programme components was achieved through the joint involvement of the participating agencies in the planning and implementation of activities and through the inclusion of biomedical and behavioural aspects within each component. The programme design comprised three key components: (1) peer education and condom distribution amongst commercial sex workers and male clients at workplaces and in the general community, supported by income-generating projects; (2) strengthened syndromic management of STI services at local health centres; and (3) open days with HIV/AIDS IEC activities at health centres to promote safer sexual behaviour and to increase the uptake of local STI treatment services.</p><p>The peer-education component was based on a model which had been developed by the Project Support Group at the University of Zimbabwe [<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and which had been widely implemented within Zimbabwe and neighbouring countries. Activities were held weekly at workplaces and at locations within the general community (e.g., beer halls and markets) where casual relationships were most frequently formed [<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The target population comprised sex workers and male clients who form a bridge population in HIV transmission [<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] between sex workers and the monogamous (or serial monogamous) majority of women [<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It was posited that the high HIV-1 incidence observed amongst young women could be reduced by altering the behaviour of their older male partners whose own behaviour was intrinsically more risky [<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The behavioural component would be reinforced in counselling sessions with STI patients and through micro-credit income-generating projects to reduce unmarried women's dependence on commercial sex work. The micro-credit scheme consisted of small interest-free loans repayable over 10 mo, provided to groups and to individuals together with training in small-business management. The targeted activities would be extended to the general population through open days held at local health centres.</p><p>Besides providing basic HIV/AIDS information, it was envisaged that programme meetings and activities, by their continuous nature, would sustain high levels of awareness of the risks of HIV transmission and would facilitate renegotiation of community social norms, making safer behaviours easier to adopt. The key messages of the programme were: (1) remain faithful to one regular sexual partner; (2) use condoms consistently with any casual sexual partners; and (3) seek prompt and effective treatment for any STIs.</p><p>Syndromic management of STIs at primary healthcare centres was first introduced in Zimbabwe in the 1980s [<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and formed the basis of STI diagnosis and treatment services at baseline in the intervention and control communities. It was envisaged that these services could be strengthened and made more effective through a programme of regular classroom training and on-site supervision of nursing staff, through the introduction of training in systemic counselling for STI patients, and through the provision of small quantities of treatment drugs to cover delays in routine supplies.</p><p>Quality-assurance procedures applied in the intervention communities included pre- and post-training tests for peer educators and, for nursing staff, attending the syndromic STI management and systemic counselling courses, regular on-site supervision (including random spot checks) and training, refresher courses, routine planning meetings and monitoring of service statistics, and quarterly workshops where detailed programme procedures were reviewed and updated. An interim qualitative process evaluation of intervention activities was conducted during the inter-survey period, and a report on the findings was provided to the implementing organisations.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Outcome and Process Measures</title><p>The primary outcome of the study was HIV-1 incidence at the community level amongst individuals who were uninfected at baseline. Blood was collected onto Whatman No. 3 filter paper and transported to the Biomedical Research and Training Institute laboratory in Harare. Blood spots were air dried at 4 &#x000b0;C and, for long-term (&#x0003e;1 mo) storage, were kept at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C. For baseline studies, blood was eluted into phosphate-buffered saline, and antibodies to HIV were detected using a dipstick dot EIA (ICL-HIV-1/HIV-2 Dipstick, [PATH, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.path.org">http://www.path.org</ext-link>; produced locally in Thailand]) and a standard protocol [<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. All positive results and a 10&#x00025; sample of negative results were confirmed using a plate EIA (Abbott Third-Generation HIV-1/HIV-2 EIA [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.abbott.com">http://www.abbott.com</ext-link>] or Genelavia MIXT HIV-1/HIV-2 [Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur, Marnes La Coquette, France]). At follow-up, a similar protocol was followed. Only the samples from those participants recorded as being HIV seronegative at baseline were tested at follow-up, again using a dot EIA (ICL-HIV-1/HIV-2 Dipstick, [PATH, produced locally in India]). Where seroconversion was indicated, the frozen stored baseline sample was retested to confirm the original negative result using the same dot EIA test. Where the baseline result remained negative, the Abbott EIA test was used to confirm both baseline and follow-up results. The change in place of manufacture of the dot EIA and the exclusive use of Abbott test kits to confirm positive sera at follow-up was due only to changes in the supply of test reagents, and not to perceived changes in sensitivity or specificity [<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Apart from the principal investigators (based in Harare, London and Oxford) and those nurses given permission by participants requesting voluntary counselling and testing (VCT), all research personnel remained blind to the HIV-1 status of individual participants.</p><p>Secondary outcomes, measured at the community and individual level, were self-reported genital ulcers and urethral or vaginal discharge in the past year (STI cases), STI treatment effectiveness (self-reported cessation of symptoms), indicators of sexual and health-seeking behaviour change, and HIV/AIDS knowledge. The behaviour-change variables assessed were sexual debut, sexual partner change in the past year, non-regular partnerships in the past month, and unprotected sex with regular and casual partners in the past 3 y. The data on sexual partnerships and condom use were collected using the Informal Confidential Voting Interview method for 75&#x00025; of respondents selected at random in the first round of the survey. This method includes procedures to build rapport, ensure a non-judgemental interview approach, and provide reassurance that there are no right or wrong answers to questions of a personal nature, and uses a simple secret voting-box system to reduce embarrassment and guarantee confidentiality in low-development settings [<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

Based on six pairs of communities and a co-efficient of variation between communities of 0.15, the required sample size in each community was 1,000. Funding constraints and slower than anticipated implementation of intervention activities led to revisions of the sample size for each community to 800 and the length of follow-up to 3 y, respectively.

Analysis of the primary outcome was on an intention-to-treat basis. Incident events and person-years at risk of seroconversion were used to calculate HIV-1 incidence rates and unadjusted and adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95&#x00025; confidence intervals (CIs) for each pair of communities. Adjustment was made for sex, 3-y age group, and community-level baseline HIV prevalence. The overall IRRs (unadjusted and adjusted) were taken to be the geometric means of the IRRs for the six pairs of communities.

The income-generating projects apart, the intervention activities were feasible. The outputs of the programme were extensive with more than 63,000 meetings being conducted and almost 7 million condoms distributed by trained peer educators. Programme messages were considered relevant and realistic. Local STI treatment and counselling services were strengthened and promoted in accordance with the intervention protocol. For male participants, these activities improved HIV/AIDS knowledge, increased the effectiveness of STI treatment, increased consistent condom use with casual partners, and reduced HIV-1 incidence. However, the cluster-RCT results clearly show that the intervention had no positive impact at the community level and suggest possible detrimental effects on the onset of female sexual activity and condom use with casual partners over a 3-y timeframe.</p><p>Did the cluster-RCT design fail to capture the true effect of the intervention? There are three possibilities: (1) inadequate statistical power; (2) insufficient follow-up; and (3) contamination of intervention within control communities. The study design provided adequate statistical power to detect a meaningful average reduction (40&#x00025;) in HIV-1 incidence in the intervention versus the control communities over a 3-y observation period. In hindsight, an effect size of 40&#x00025; was too optimistic and the study had insufficient power to detect a smaller effect. However, there was no trend in the results towards reduced HIV-1 incidence in the intervention communities. Largely due to migration, attrition was close to that anticipated in the study design and was comparable to other recent cohort studies [<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Migrants had similar characteristics and sexual behaviour to non-migrants [<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>The results of the exploratory sub-group analysis generate the hypothesis that high-risk behaviour was reduced in males attending programme meetings but did not translate into a wider impact on HIV-1 incidence at the population level. Changes in core and bridge populations may take more time to reflect in the general population than was observed in the trial. However, a longer period of follow-up would have increased attrition, and the finding of a possible adverse effect at the population level meant that it would not have been ethical to continue with the same intervention. Future trials of behaviour-change interventions may need to include multiple rounds with phased recruitment and (where interim results are favourable) may need to consider phased intervention implementation.</p><p>We minimised intervention contamination by selecting physically separated study communities, and movements between intervention and control communities were rare. However, a similar peer-education programme was implemented in one control community (small town), and HIV-1&#x02013;prevention activity was considerable in all control communities that also had greater access to information from external sources. In some cases, programme messages (e.g., promotion of condom use) conflicted with those of other agencies working in the intervention communities. The effects of these other programmes could have limited our ability to detect a reduction in HIV-1 incidence caused by the current intervention.</p><p>The absence of an observed effect of the intervention was not explained by differences in HIV-1 prevalence, sexual behaviour, STI cofactors, mobility, or socio-demographic composition at baseline. The earlier sexual debut in females and greater unprotected sex with casual partners seen in the intervention communities during the study period were not present at baseline but could reflect increased willingness to report high-risk behaviours in settings where there was more open discourse about HIV and AIDS.</p><p>The peer-education programme could have had some effect for male but not for unmarried female participants. Preliminary findings from subsequent qualitative investigations indicate that, in the predominantly rural communities in which the study was conducted, poverty and the associated failure of income-generating projects meant that some peer educators were unable to maintain safer behaviours. Given their increased visibility within the community&#x02014;intended to enhance their status and self-esteem and, thus, to reinforce their commitment to and role as models for behaviour change&#x02014;they may, inadvertently, have served as negative role models and, thereby, may have contributed to the greater female early-age sexual activity. Free distribution of condoms by women still engaging in unprotected commercial sex led to their being poorly valued and reinforced their association with promiscuity.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generalisability of Findings</title><p>Epidemiological context can affect the impact of interventions [<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and structural obstacles can limit the pace and extent to which activities are implemented and the quality of these activities [<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The HIV-1 epidemic stabilised in eastern Zimbabwe during the study period, with HIV-1 prevalence declining by 40&#x00025;&#x02013;50&#x00025; in young adults [<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This decline was accompanied by delayed sexual debut, reduced sexual partner change, and consistent condom use with casual partners [<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Prevalence of syphilis, gonorrhoea, and Chlamydia is low, but non-curable herpes simplex virus type 2 remains common [<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Risk reduction makes transmission more fragile, and an intervention could have a larger effect when set against secular behavioural changes [<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Mathematical model simulations suggest that there would also be a greater chance of detecting a significant effect of the intervention even though there would be fewer seroconversions to power the calculation [<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Structural obstacles to intervention implementation included HIV/AIDS mortality which disrupted the programme by claiming the lives of two programme coordinators and several of the nursing staff and peer-educators. Economic decline made the income-generating projects unfeasible and reduced the effectiveness of other components of the intervention. We believe that the coverage of the peer-education programme was satisfactory, given the focus on highly sexually active individuals. Meeting coverage could have been under-estimated in the survey since one-to-one discussions and activities at beer halls and other public places may not have been recognised as meetings by those present. However, the high level of spatial mobility limited the number of people who were reached at the required level of intensity and consistency, whilst national shortages of foreign currency restricted fuel and drug supplies, hampered attempts to extend community activities into the more remote rural areas, and disrupted the STI treatment programme in both the intervention and control communities.</p><p>The intervention that we evaluated could have greater effect where an HIV-1 epidemic is younger, HIV-1 incidence is greater, local sexual networks are less diffuse, background STI control is weak, herpes simplex virus type 2 is less common, population mobility is lower, and/or the socio-economic climate is stable. We cannot rule out an effect of peer education in the urban intervention community since similar activities were implemented in the control community. Targeted peer education may work better in towns where bar-based sex work is more extensive. The absence of reduced HIV-1 incidence in farming estates reinforces doubts raised by the Harare factory workers study [<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] concerning the efficacy of workplace peer education.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Overall Evidence</title><p>These findings are important since the strategies evaluated&#x02014;i.e., peer education, condom distribution, and syndromic STI management&#x02014;are theory-based, have the potential for independent effects [<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and are widely promoted [<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

Social marketing of condoms [<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], larger poverty-alleviation programmes to reduce women's reliance on sex work&#x02014;based on skills training and careful market research rather than on small-scale income-generating projects&#x02014;and strategies which reach beyond high-activity core groups, such as the Popular Opinion Leader programme [<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and client-centred counselling [<xref rid="pmed-0040102-b040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], could be more viable and effective in reducing HIV-1 transmission in rural areas.
