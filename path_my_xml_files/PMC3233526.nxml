The ultimate goal of providing iron supplementation to a healthy, nonanemic pregnant woman is to ensure sufficient iron storage in her body to provide effective cover for the increased physiologic need of iron during pregnancy, because the natural mechanisms of increasing iron intake, such as higher absorption of iron from the gastrointestinal tract, are not always adequate. Women with iron deficiency are particularly susceptible to iron deficiency anemia during pregnancy, because the demand for iron increases from 0.8 to &#x02264;7.5 mg of absorbed iron per day.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-tcrm-7-421">10</xref> Latent or overt iron deficiency will gradually progress to iron deficiency anemia, characterized by microcytosis and increased amounts of protoporphyrin IX in red blood cells,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-tcrm-7-421">4</xref> which is linked with a risk of an unfavorable pregnancy outcome, as mentioned previously.</p><p>In the Islamic Republic of Iran, the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women varies between 2.4% and 27.8% with respect to specific regions,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-tcrm-7-421">11</xref> and thus represents a severe public health issue. The current policy of the Iranian Ministry of Health is to examine pregnant women for anemia at 12&#x02013;17 weeks&#x02019; gestation and to supply 30 mg/ day of iron as ferrous sulfate to each pregnant woman from gestational week 20 until three months after delivery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-tcrm-7-421">11</xref></p><p>However, discussion regarding the true desirability of daily iron supplements versus intermittent iron supplements has arisen in recent years. The reasons for initial consideration of other than daily iron supplementation regimens are based on the lack of effectiveness of daily iron intervention in developing countries,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-tcrm-7-421">12</xref> indicated by low compliance with many daily supplementation programs,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-tcrm-7-421">12</xref> insufficient supply of iron,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-tcrm-7-421">11</xref> and insufficient coverage of at-risk populations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-tcrm-7-421">12</xref> More evidence-based theory behind intermittent iron supplementation reflects the original concept of mucosal block of iron absorption due to an increase in the proportion of iron that is stored in the enterocyte, and a decrease in transfer of iron to transferrin in the vascular pool,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-tcrm-7-421">13</xref> confirmed decades later to some extent by in vivo studies in rats showing a rapid decline in the absorptive and iron retention capacities during daily iron administration compared with an intermittent regimen.

The study population was randomly drawn from pregnant women attending local public health care centers at seven prenatal health care clinics between September, 2007 and February, 2009. Thirty women were finally enrolled at each participating clinic. The women were invited to participate in the study during their first visit to the government antenatal clinic at 17&#x02013;20 weeks and were informed by an assigned health care provider of its purpose, the procedures and tests entailed, and what data would be collected for analysis. Participants were free to withdraw from the study at any time without any disadvantage to themselves. Written informed consent was obtained from each literate woman and an improvised linear shaped signature in front of a witness was obtained on behalf of illiterate women who agreed to participate in the study. Before the start of the study, its protocol was approved by the University Ethics Committee and by the Faculty of Medicine. The protocol required participants to take the supplements on an assigned basis, to fill out forms about pill-taking and return these at each return clinic visit, and to have a 5 mL venipuncture for hemoglobin and ferritin concentration at 20, 28, and 38 weeks&#x02019; gestation. Women with previously demonstrated low hemoglobin levels or overt anemia were not eligible to participate. Exclusion criteria were hemoglobin &#x0003c;11 g/dL, noncompliance, intolerance of iron tablets or a physician&#x02019;s recommendation to refrain from iron intake, previous consumption of iron-containing supplements, multiple pregnancy, thalassemia, chronic systemic disease, eclampsia or pre-eclampsia, more than five previous completed pregnancies, history of bleeding or surgery during previous pregnancy, pregnancy terminated before 36 weeks, and relocation to another area.</p><sec><title>Sample size, allocation of group, and tablet intake</title><p>A total of 210 nonanemic pregnant women with a hemoglobin level &#x0003e;11.0 g/dL, set as a cutoff value for anemia based on the WHO definition,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-tcrm-7-421">16</xref> were recruited at &#x0003e;17 and &#x0003c;20 weeks of gestation for participation in this study. The power of the study was 80%, and the level of significance was considered to be <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05. The prevalence of anemia at delivery in the daily control group versus weekly group was reported to be 9% versus 45%, respectively, according to a literature review. The women were randomly assigned to receive two iron tablets once weekly (100 mg/dose, Group A), one tablet twice weekly (50 mg/dose, Group B), or once daily (50 mg/day) as ferrous sulfate. The weekly supplemented group received two 50 mg ferrous sulfate tablets on Friday, and the twice-weekly supplemented group received one 50 mg ferrous sulfate tablet on Monday and Wednesday. Therefore, both groups received the same total amount of elemental iron per week, ie, 100 mg. All women were instructed to take the tablets on an empty stomach before sleep.</p><p>Subsequently, at 28 weeks&#x02019; gestation, four women were excluded due to hemoglobin &#x0003c;11 g/dL, lack of compliance (n = 2, Groups A and B) or relocation to another area (n = 2, Group A). Two hundred and six women continued to participate in the study beyond 28 weeks. Data for the excluded women were not included in the final analysis.</p><p>At 38 weeks, three women from Group A were excluded due to hemoglobin levels &#x0003c;11 g/dL and two women decided of their own volition to transfer to a daily supplementation regimen based on the recommendation of their private physician, in spite of having safe hemoglobin levels (12.8 g/dL and 11.7 g/dL). Two hundred and one women completed the study protocol and their data were analyzed. The study outline is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-tcrm-7-421">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>Data on age, body weight, parity, and height were recorded at the time of study enrolment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-tcrm-7-421">Table 1</xref>). Body mass index was calculated according to the standard formula as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters, and weight gain was assessed by the difference in weight at 20 and 38 weeks&#x02019; gestation. Parity was determined by self-reporting and calculated as the number of deliveries assigned to a particular group divided by total number of completed pregnancies reported by women in the group.</p></sec><sec><title>Serum ferritin and hemoglobin levels</title><p>Participants were sent to a reference laboratory at assigned weeks of gestation according to the protocol to provide venous blood samples for assessment of hemoglobin and serum ferritin concentrations. Women with hemoglobin &#x0003c; 11 g/dL at or after 28 weeks&#x02019; gestation (n = 3, Group A) were excluded from the study and referred to a physician to be treated with daily supplementation of two 50 mg ferrous sulfate tablets until the end of their pregnancy, and this supplementation regimen was continued for three months after delivery. The remaining participants were followed until delivery and a blood sample was obtained according to the protocol at 38 weeks&#x02019; gestation. After delivery, data on infant outcome (birth weight and gestational age) were collected from the family medical file at the local health center and analyzed. Venous blood samples of 5 mL obtained at 20, 28, and 38 weeks&#x02019; gestation were analyzed for hemoglobin level by the antenatal clinic reference laboratory using an H1 automated counter (Technicon, Bayer, Tehran, Iran). At these times, a second tube of venous blood was collected for measurement of serum ferritin concentration and kept refrigerated until analysis. Samples for that assessment were analysed in the same laboratory using an immunoradiometric assay technique (Kavoshyar Ferritin IRMA [I<sub>125</sub>] kit, Kavoshyar Iran Co, Tehran, Iran).</p></sec><sec><title>Adherence to regimen and side effects</title><p>Overall adherence to the regime was calculated as the number of tablets women swallowed according to given forms, divided by the total number of tablets they should have received during supplementation, ie, number of weeks enrolled in the program multiplied by the number of tablets received in each group.

Gestational age was determined either on the basis of a participant-reported estimate of the last menstrual period or by an ultrasound examination performed early in the pregnancy. Determination of preterm birth was based solely on duration of gestation, with deliveries that occurred at &#x0003c;37 completed weeks designated as preterm. Deliveries via cesarean section and stillbirths were noted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>An analysis of variance test was used to assess baseline characteristics across the groups.

Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric analysis of variance was used for comparison of mean ferritin and hemoglobin levels across the groups. Unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to compare continuous outcomes between the randomization groups, and Chi-squared tests and post hoc tests, where appropriate, were used to compare differences in categorical outcomes. Risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated for comparisons between the supplementation groups for the outcomes of preterm delivery. Statistical significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05.

Our data suggest that there is no significant benefit of daily iron supplementation over intermittent dosing regimes for maintenance of safe hematologic marker levels and for preventing pregnancy and neonatal complications in pregnant women who are nonanemic at &#x02264;20 weeks. The absence of a placebo control group allows only a comparison between daily, twice-weekly, and once-weekly supplementation groups. However, given that it has been well established by various studies that daily antenatal iron supplementation increases hemoglobin levels in maternal blood both antenatally and postnatally,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-tcrm-7-421">17</xref> that absence of iron supplementation during pregnancy increases the risk of anemia,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-tcrm-7-421">18</xref> and that various countries now recommend routine iron supplementation as a conceptual part of their public health care policy (US, France,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-tcrm-7-421">19</xref> Iran), our goal was not to assess the impact of absence of iron supplementation in comparison with iron supplies, but to compare the effect of various iron supplementation regimens in a matched sample of pregnant women.</p><p>In the women who were nonanemic at 20&#x02264;weeks&#x02019; gestation, weekly supplementation was less effective in preventing hemoglobin levels &#x0003c;11 g/dL compared with twice-weekly and daily supplementation regimes. However, the twice-weekly regime has shown equal effectiveness as a daily supplementation regimen with respect to maintaining safe hemoglobin and ferritin levels throughout pregnancy. In addition to this, based on WHO criteria for the lowest (5th percentile) mid-pregnancy hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-tcrm-7-421">16</xref> also proposed by Milman et al,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-tcrm-7-421">20</xref> none of the women who were excluded due to hemoglobin levels &#x0003c;11 g/dL at 28 weeks were in fact anemic (10.6, 10.7, and 10.7 g/dL). Moreover, this finding could be explained by the physiologic hemodilution that occurs during this stage of pregnancy. The reason they were transferred to a daily supplementation regimen was based on a cutoff point of 11 g/dL for anemia in pregnant women throughout pregnancy applied in routine Iranian clinical practice in accordance with the Iranian Ministry of Health recommendation.</p><p>Although hemoglobin levels were significantly lower in Group B compared with Groups A and C (<italic>P</italic> = 0.018) at 38 weeks, the difference was not clinically significant (Hb level &#x0003e;11 g/dL). A similar trend was observed for the difference in ferritin levels, in that although daily supplementation led to a significant increase in ferritin at 28 weeks (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03), this difference was not maintained towards 38 weeks in comparison with the other two regimes. Group B, on the other hand, achieved significantly lower ferritin levels compared with Group A and Group C at 38 weeks, but again this was not clinically significant.</p><p>Various studies comparing daily versus intermittent regimens have shown that the intermittent regimen is less effective in anemic pregnant women,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-tcrm-7-421">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-tcrm-7-421">22</xref> while other studies conducted in anemic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-tcrm-7-421">23</xref> and nonanemic<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-tcrm-7-421">24</xref> women demonstrate equal efficacy,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-tcrm-7-421">25</xref> frequently due to poor adherence to the regime in the daily supplementation setting. In addition to equal ability to maintain safe hematologic markers on both regimes, studies also report a possible adverse effect of hemoconcentration on birth outcome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-tcrm-7-421">24</xref> and other aspects associated with daily exposure to iron, such as hypertension, in healthy nonanemic women.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-tcrm-7-421">26</xref></p><p>At 38 weeks, 15.7% women in Group C had hemoconcentration, compared with 8.1% and 7.3% in Group A and Group B, respectively. However, the initial hemoglobin levels were higher in Group C (12.9% had hemoconcentration at week 20 compared with 5.3% in Group B), which may account for the considerably higher percentage of women with hemoconcentration in this group at the time of delivery.</p><p>It is noteworthy that many studies comparing daily versus intermittent iron supplementation attribute the low effectiveness of routine daily administration to low adherence with the daily regimen,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-tcrm-7-421">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-tcrm-7-421">27</xref> which is mainly due to the side effects of daily iron supplementation. Given the fact that all women in our study reported full adherence and no side effects, it may be important to study the social characteristics of target study populations to verify this finding.</p><p>Another aspect that may have played a role in the significantly high adherence during this study is that all women were informed in detail about the general effects and benefits of iron on the course of their pregnancy and its outcome, and were clearly instructed on how and when to take their tablet(s). This is in accordance with another compliance study demonstrating that this approach increases compliance rates.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-tcrm-7-421">27</xref></p><p>The dietary habits of the study sample were not specifically recorded, but given the relative ethnic, religious, and socioeconomic homogeneity of the participating women, it may be reasonably assumed that there were no significant differences in their diet. None of the participating women were vegetarians, and all were informed regarding proper dietary composition during pregnancy. In accordance with Islamic law, which does not allow pregnant women to fast, none were fasting. Several studies have demonstrated that anemia in pregnancy is associated with a risk of low birth weight or premature delivery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-tcrm-7-421">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-tcrm-7-421">30</xref> Our study shows that low birth weight occurred with equal frequency in the daily and weekly supplementation groups (n = 1 in each group), while no low birth weight infants occurred in the twice-weekly group.</p><p>Pan-population approaches using global routine iron supplementation, although introduced, eg, in India in the early 70s,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-tcrm-7-421">21</xref> have proven to be ineffective in reducing the prevalence of anemia during pregnancy. Moreover, such approaches may not be safe in all circumstances, as shown by studies demonstrating an adverse effect on pregnancy outcome in women with higher hemoglobin levels who receive iron supplementation. Currently there is no general solution for this worldwide problem, which rather emphasizes the need for careful evaluation of target populations with respect to social, dietary, and religious customs, and in particular the need for an individual approach in each pregnant woman. Rigid iron supplementation rules based on inaccurate generalizations from studies conducted in different global and political regions in different ethnic populations and sometimes in a different decade may eventually cause harm instead of benefit in a subset of pregnant women and their babies.</p><p>In conclusion, our study shows that assessment of hematologic parameters in early pregnancy should be routinely incorporated into prenatal care and, based on this evaluation, appropriate iron supplementation should be proposed for every woman, regardless of location or background. This regimen should be in accordance with local and national population health and the woman&#x02019;s individual medical history and needs. From a more general perspective, a heated debate concerning daily versus intermittent iron supplementation has developed in recent years. Both approaches have been corroborated with clinical trials, yet no clear conclusion can be reached. Although our results do not provide a definite answer, they do suggest that, in nonanemic women, a twice-weekly iron supplementation regime may represent a reasonable compromise for an initial iron dosing regimen in nonpregnant women that may be adjusted in concordance with the development of iron markers during pregnancy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We would like
