The incidence of sepsis worldwide is on the increase. Sepsis and its sequels are the leading causes of death in intensive care units. Mortality rates are higher for patients with pre-existing disease, medical conditions, care in the intensive care unit, and multiple organ failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Despite steady improvements in antibiotic therapy and intensive care management during the past decade, mortality has remained close to 50%. This high mortality rate has continued to stimulate interest in pharmacological agents that might reduce morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Steroid therapy in patients with sepsis is still controversial. In the 1960s, stress doses of hydrocortisone for the treatment of sepsis were investigated, but no advantages could be shown in a double-blind multicenter study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This led to the discontinuation of steroid replacement therapy for sepsis. In the 1970s, therapy with pharmacological doses of glucocorticoids was widely used in patients with sepsis and septic shock. The most compelling evidence in favor of corticosteroid treatment was reported by Schumer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] in his prospective randomized study of steroid administration to patients with septic shock. These data indicate that methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg) or dexamethasone (3 mg/kg) reduced the mortality rate from 38.4% to 10.5%. However, later in the mid-1980s, pharmacological doses of glucocorticoids for the treatment of sepsis were investigated extensively until several clinical trials gave negative results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Moreover, there is some evidence that the use of high-dose glucocorticoids in sepsis might be harmful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Many studies have demonstrated that elevated cortisol levels in sepsis and the degree of elevation are related to the severity of illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Basal and corticotropin (ACTH)-stimulated cortisol levels correlate with the severity of illness, and very high cortisol levels often signify a poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In sepsis, the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal axis is activated through systemic and neural pathways. Circulating cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1;, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 activate the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal axis independently and, when combined, have synergistic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Sepsis can also cause adrenal insufficiency (AI), which is associated with increased mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In recent years, several authors have proposed a syndrome of occult AI in septic shock in the presence of normal or even elevated serum cortisol concentrations. This hypothesis is based on many studies investigating the adrenocortical response of patients with septic shock to 0.25 mg of ACTH. Up to 28% of seriously ill patients have been suggested to have occult or unrecognized AI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The prevalence of occult AI (a cortisol increment after a short ACTH test of less than 9 mg/dl) in severe sepsis was estimated at about 50% and the 28-day mortality rate at about 75% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A few studies have indicated that stress doses of hydrocortisone improve hemody-namics in patients with hyperdynamic septic shock, which is unresponsive to conventional therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, the use of a physiological dose of steroid in patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock has not yet been completely evaluated. We therefore performed a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, single-center study.</p><p>The aim of this study was to assess basal cortisol concentrations and the cortisol response to ACTH stimulation as well as their prognostic importance, and also to determine the effects of the physiological-dose steroid therapy on mortality in patients with sepsis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Erciyes University and informed consent was obtained from the patients' relatives.

In addition, patients with burns, hemorrhagic shock or those who had suffered myocar-dial infarction were not included.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment protocol</title><p>Patients enrolled in the study were treated with standard therapy used in the treatment of sepsis and septic shock. This therapy could include the following: administration of antibiotics, fluid replacement, vasoactive drugs, mechanical ventila-tory support, and any other form of supportive therapy deemed necessary by the primary physicians. Soon after the presumptive diagnosis of severe sepsis, initial laboratory specimens were obtained and within 2 hours the patients were randomized to treatment with prednisolone or placebo groups. The treatment groups were determined by a computer-generated randomization procedure. The steroid therapy group received prednisolone at a physiological dose. Prednisolone was given intravenously at 06.00 (5 mg) and 18.00 (2.5 mg) for 10 days. The standard therapy group received a placebo infusion containing physiological saline solution in an identical manner. Patients and their primary physicians were blinded as to which therapy was administered.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>An ACTH stimulation test was performed with 250 g of tetracosactrin (synacthene; Ciba Geigy, Germany) given intravenously. Blood samples were taken immediately before the test and at 30 and 60 minutes afterwards. After centrifugation, plasma samples were stored at -20&#x000b0;C until assayed. ACTH stimulation test was repeated on the 14th day in the patients who survived. Plasma cortisol concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay with a commercially available kit (ICN Biomedicals, Inc, Costa Mesa, California, USA). Intra-assay coefficients of variation were for control A 7.0%, control B 5.8%, and control C 5.1%. Inter-assay coefficients of variation were for control A 7.9%, control B 6.5%, control C 6.0%. The cortisol response was defined as the difference between the basal and peak cortisol concentrations. Normal adrenal function was defined as a plasma cortisol level (before or at 30 or 60 minutes after the injection of ACTH) above 20 &#x003bc;g/dl. The cases with peak cortisol levels lower than 20 &#x003bc;g/dl were considered to be AI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].

Although a univariate analysis found vasopressor therapy (OR 4.64, 95% CI 1.02&#x02013;21.00), APACHE II (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.04&#x02013;1.34) and maximum SOFA (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.23&#x02013;2.16) to be effective on mortality, only the SOFA score was found related to mortality, independently of other factors (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.01&#x02013;4.30) in a multivariate analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of mortality rates for <bold>(a)</bold> basal cortisol (&#x003bc;g/dl), <bold>(b)</bold> cortisol response to ACTH (&#x003bc;g/dl), <bold>(c)</bold> APACHE II and <bold>(d)</bold> maximum SOFA scores in both groups.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cc1498-1"/></fig><table-wrap position="float" id="T3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Average values (means &#x000b1; SD) of basal cortisol, peak cortisol, cortisol responses to corticotropin, APACHE II and maximum SOFA scores according to survivors and non-survivors in both groups on the first day</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="center" colspan="3">Steroid therapy group</td><td align="center" colspan="3">Standard therapy group</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td><td colspan="3"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Variable</td><td align="center">Non-survivors (<italic>n</italic> = 8)</td><td align="center">Survivors (<italic>n</italic> = 12)</td><td align="center"><italic>P</italic></td><td align="center">Non-survivors (<italic>n</italic> = 12)</td><td align="center">Survivors (<italic>n</italic> = 8)</td><td align="center"><italic>P</italic></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Basal cortisol level (&#x003bc;g/dl)</td><td align="center">44.4 &#x000b1; 24.8</td><td align="center">52.5 &#x000b1; 30.5</td><td align="center">0.536</td><td align="center">60.5 &#x000b1; 34.7</td><td align="center">40.3 &#x000b1; 19.9</td><td align="center">0.154</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Peak cortisol level (&#x003bc;g/dl)</td><td align="center">73.1 &#x000b1; 35.1</td><td align="center">79.2 &#x000b1; 33.5</td><td align="center">0.699</td><td align="center">80.7 &#x000b1; 45.9</td><td align="center">60.1 &#x000b1; 25.7</td><td align="center">0.265</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Cortisol response (&#x003bc;g/dl)</td><td align="center">28.7 &#x000b1; 22.1</td><td align="center">21.2 &#x000b1; 32.7</td><td align="center">0.579</td><td align="center">16.3 &#x000b1; 24.6</td><td align="center">18.2 &#x000b1; 16.3</td><td align="center">0.835</td></tr><tr><td align="left">APACHE II score</td><td align="center">17.6 &#x000b1; 4.5</td><td align="center">13.8 &#x000b1; 5.8</td><td align="center">0.130</td><td align="center">21 &#x000b1; 7.9</td><td align="center">13.3 &#x000b1; 6</td><td align="center">0.024</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Maximum SOFA score</td><td align="center">10.6 &#x000b1; 3.2</td><td align="center">5.9 &#x000b1; 3.3</td><td align="center">0.009</td><td align="center">11.4 &#x000b1; 2.9</td><td align="center">6 &#x000b1; 3.3</td><td align="center">0.003</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>APACHE, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation; SOFA, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Variations of treatment effects on the 28-day mortality among subgroups</title><p>The mortality rates among patients with a cortisol level over 60 &#x003bc;g/dl were 29% (2 of 7) in the steroid therapy group and 78% (7 of 9) in the standard therapy group (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> = 3.874, <italic>P</italic> = 0.126).

Only one patient, in the standard therapy group, had a secondary infection.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Sepsis is a severe and life-threatening disease. Septic shock is associated with a mortality rate of more than 50%. Despite improvements in the overall management of such patients, including intensive fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, and life-support devices, mortality rates have not improved during the past decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In this randomized, double-blind study of the physiological dose of intravenous prednisolone or placebo in the treatment of sepsis, we observed an important difference in mortality rates between both groups. The mortality rates were 40% in the steroid therapy group and 60% in the standard treatment group. There was a trend towards a decrease in the mortality rate of the patients with sepsis who received physiological-dose steroid therapy. However, the differences were not statisti-&#x003bc; cally significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.343). Several factors were suspected to be associated with mortality in sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Annane <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] reported that SOFA score, high plasma cortisol levels and weak response of cortisol to ACTH were also associated with mortality. However, we found that only SOFA score was related to mortality, independently of other factors (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.02&#x02013;4.22) in the multivariate analysis.</p><p>Briegel <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] showed that stress doses of hydrocorti-sone reduce the time for the reversal of shock, the number of organ system failures, and the length of mechanical ventilation in patients with septic shock. This finding underlines the fact that an impaired adrenocortical function contributes to vascular hyporesponsiveness in septic shock. In contrast to other studies, our study was performed in patients with sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock with the use of physiological-dose prednisolone with or without vasopressor support. Because the administration of prednisolone does not affect the circadian adrenocortical patterns and the results of an ACTH stimulation test in adults, we preferred to use this drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In this study we did not completely evaluate the effect of the steroid on patients with vasopressor-dependent septic shock. However, in a few patients, a physiological dose of prednisolone reduces the time for the reversal of shock as defined by the cessation of vasopressor therapy.</p><p>It is known that the plasma cortisol level increases in critical illnesses and that basal cortisol levels have a positive correlation with severity of illness and prognosis. However, some investigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] showed that patients with sepsis and high baseline cortisol levels had a lower cortisol response to the ACTH stimulation test. Our entire study group had higher mean random basal and stimulated cortisol levels than those seen in outpatients. The difference between the basal cortisol levels on the 1st and 14th days in patients who recovered was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). We have also shown that basal cortisol levels correlate with the severity of the illness, and that very high corti-sol levels signify a poor prognosis in the standard therapy group (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>Clinically significant AI is unusual in outpatients. The studies of adrenal function in critically ill patients report conflicting incidences of AI ranging from 0% to 28% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Our results show a low incidence of AI in septic patients. One of our 40 patients had abnormal basal and peak cortisol levels (less than 20 g/dl) and died. This condition was evaluated as AI. In the advancing process from sepsis to septic shock, we concluded that AI was not so frequent as supposed.</p><p>In recent years, several authors have proposed a syndrome of occult AI in septic shock in the presence of normal or even elevated serum cortisol concentrations. Annane <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] reported that 50% of patients with severe sepsis had occult AI. In the present study, 14 (35%) of the 40 patients had a subnormal cortisol response (occult AI). Five patients in the steroid treatment group had an inadequate cortisol response; two of them died. However, five of nine patients in the standard treatment group who showed inadequate cortisol response died. No statistical differences were observed in mortality rates between the patients who had occult AI (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> = 0.311, <italic>P</italic> = 1) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, a physiological dose of intravenous pred-nisolone had a tendency towards a decrease in mortality in the patients with sepsis, but the difference between the two groups was not significant. Because our study had a small sample size and showed heterogeneity in population in terms of clinical severity, treatment with physiological-dose steroid in sepsis should be evaluated in a larger group of patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Key messages</title><p>&#x000b7; There was an increase in the level of basal cortisol in patients with sepsis.</p><p>&#x000b7; In the advancing process from
