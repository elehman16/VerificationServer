Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-based therapies stimulate insulin secretion and reduce glucagon secretion only during hyperglycaemia. GLP-1 also slows gastric emptying and reduces appetite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>].</p><p>Although American Diabetes Association (ADA)/European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) guidelines recommend lifestyle and metformin as initial therapy for T2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>], sulphonylureas are used widely, particularly when metformin or thiazolidinediones are not tolerated. Glycaemic control eventually deteriorates with sulphonylureas while hypoglycaemia and weight gain are common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>]. Incretin therapy improves glycaemic control with low hypoglycaemic risk, while delayed gastric emptying and reduced appetite can reduce weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>].</p><p>Liraglutide is a once-daily human GLP-1 analogue with 97% linear amino-acid sequence homology to human GLP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>] and half-life of 13 h after subcutaneous administration that produces 24-h blood glucose control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>]. Liraglutide monotherapy for 14 weeks reduced glycated haemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) by 1.7% and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) by 3.4 mmol/l without causing hypoglycaemia, along with weight loss (&#x0223c;3 kg) compared with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>]. Improvements in pancreatic B-cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>] and blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>], along with decreased glucagon secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>], also occurred. As part of the phase 3 programme [the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes (LEAD) programme] with liraglutide in &#x0003e; 4000 subjects with T2D as monotherapy or in combination therapy, this 26-week trial examined liraglutide plus glimepiride compared with either placebo or rosiglitazone added to glimepiride on glycaemic control and body weight.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec><title>Study participants</title><p>Inclusion criteria: T2D treated with oral glucose-lowering agents (OGLAs) for &#x02265; 3 months; 18&#x02013;80 years of age; HbA<sub>1c</sub> 7.0&#x02013;11.0% (previous OGLA monotherapy) or 7.0&#x02013;10.0% (previous OGLA combination therapy); body mass index (BMI) &#x02264; 45.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.

After discontinuing previous OGLAs except glimepiride, separate 2-week titration and maintenance periods with glimepiride (open-label) preceded randomization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). Subjects were stratified according to previous treatment (monotherapy or combination therapy). After randomization, 2-week treatment titration and 24-week treatment (maintenance) phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>) were completed. Liraglutide was up-titrated weekly in 0.6-mg increments until allocated doses were reached. Glimepiride could be adjusted between 2 and 4 mg/day in case of hypoglycaemia or other adverse events (AEs), while other drug doses were fixed. Liraglutide (active and placebo) was supplied in 3-ml pre-filled pens with 31G needles (Novo Nordisk). Subjects were encouraged to inject liraglutide into the upper arm, thigh or abdomen at the same time each day. Rosiglitazone and glimepiride were taken in the morning or with the first meal.</p></sec><sec><title>Study measurements</title><sec><title>Efficacy</title><p>The primary endpoint was change from baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> after 26 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints included: percentages of subjects reaching HbA<sub>1c</sub> (&#x0003c; 7.0%, &#x02264; 6.5%), FPG (5.0 to &#x02264; 7.2 mmol/l) and postprandial plasma glucose (PPG; 10.0 mmol/l) targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>]; changes in body weight, FPG, mean PPG, indices of pancreatic B-cell function [pro-insulin : insulin ratio and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-B], HOMA-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and blood pressure (BP).</p><p>HbA<sub>1c</sub> was measured centrally (MDS Pharma Services, King of Prussia, PA, USA) by high performance liquid chromatography while plasma glucose (PG) was self-measured using MediSense&#x000ae; glucose meters (Abbott Diagnostics Inc., Abbott Park, IL, USA). Insulin and C-peptide were measured by chemiluminescence, proinsulin by ELISA, while glucagon was measured in aprotinin-treated plasma by radioimmunoassay. The proinsulin : insulin ratio was calculated from fasting insulin and fasting proinsulin. HOMA-B and HOMA-IR were both calculated from FPG and fasting insulin. Samples measured centrally were collected and transported according to detailed procedures in the MDS Pharma Services manual. Samples stored at ambient temperature were shipped by courier to the central laboratory on the same day as collection, while frozen samples were shipped every 3 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>Safety variables included hypoglycaemic episodes based on PG levels (&#x0003c; 3.1 mmol/l), liraglutide antibodies including cross-reacting and neutralizing antibodies, tolerability (gastrointestinal complaints) and pulse. AEs, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), biochemical and haematology measures including calcitonin were also monitored. Self-treated hypoglycaemic episodes were classified as minor, while those requiring third-party assistance were considered major. Serum antibodies against liraglutide were measured by radioimmunoprecipitation assay.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All efficacy and safety analyses were based on intent-to-treat criteria, defined as subjects who were exposed to &#x02265; 1 dose of trial product(s). Efficacy endpoints were analysed by <sc>ancova</sc> with treatment, country and previous glucose-lowering treatment as fixed effects and baseline values as covariates. Missing data were imputed by last observation carried forward (LOCF). Sample size calculations were based on predicted HbA<sub>1c</sub> and body weight after trial completion. As the three liraglutide + glimepiride groups were to be compared with both rosiglitazone + glimepiride and glimepiride monotherapy, two calculations were performed. These sample size calculations assumed a standard deviation of 1.2% of HbA<sub>1c</sub>, the non-inferiority/superiority margin vs. active control was set to 0.4% and the difference to detect (superiority vs. placebo) was set to 0.5%. For body weight, a coefficient of variation of 3% (based on phase 2a trials for liraglutide) and a difference to detect of 3% were assumed. A combined power (calculated as the product of the marginal powers for HbA<sub>1c</sub> and body weight) of at least 85% was required. These calculations indicated that at least 168 and 81 patients completing the study would be needed for the combination and glimepiride monotherapy groups, respectively. Assuming a drop-out rate of 25%, targets for randomization were 228 in each of the combination therapy groups and 114 in the placebo group (total <italic>n</italic> = 1026).</p><p>To protect against Type 1 errors, HbA<sub>1c</sub> was analysed using hierarchical testing for descending doses of liraglutide. First, superiority of liraglutide 1.8 mg to placebo was tested and, only if superior to placebo, non-inferiority to rosiglitazone was tested. If non-inferiority was obtained, superiority to rosiglitazone for liraglutide 1.8 mg was tested and superiority to placebo for liraglutide 1.2 mg was tested. If superiority was confirmed, non-inferiority to rosiglitazone would be tested and so on (i.e. testing sequence was stopped when hypotheses could not be rejected). Superiority was concluded when upper limits of two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for treatment differences were below 0%; non-inferiority was concluded if these values were &#x0003c; 0.4%; for secondary endpoints, Type 1 errors were controlled by estimating simultaneous CIs using Dunnett's method.</p><p>Proportions of subjects achieving HbA<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c; 7.0%, and &#x02264; 6.5%) and FPG (5.0 &#x02264; FPG &#x02264; 7.2 mmol/l) targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>] were compared between treatments using logistic regression with allocated treatment and baseline values as covariates. Chi-square analyses assessed differences in treatments for percentages of subjects achieving no, one, two or three PPG values &#x0003c; 10 mmol/l [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>]. Hypoglycaemic episodes were analysed under the assumption that number per subject were negatively binomially distributed using a generalized linear model, including treatment and country as fixed effects. Other safety data were compared by descriptive statistics. Values for descriptive statistics are expressed as means &#x000b1; <sc>sd,</sc> while <sc>ancova</sc> results are expressed as least square means &#x000b1; SEM or with 95% CI unless otherwise noted. Significance levels were set to 5% for two-sided tests and 2.5% for one-sided tests.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Disposition and demographics</title><p>The treatment groups were well balanced (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Similar findings for reductions in FPG and PPG highlight improved 24-h glucose control with once-daily liraglutide, with substantially more subjects reaching glycaemic targets, particularly with liraglutide 1.8 mg. Improvements in pancreatic B-cell function were larger with liraglutide 1.2 and 1.8 mg compared with rosiglitazone. Liraglutide was well tolerated and occurrence of gastrointestinal AEs was low overall, particularly after week 4.</p><p>Although rates of hypoglycaemia were low in all treatment groups (&#x0003c; 10%), minor hypoglycaemic events occurred more often in patients treated with glimepiride plus liraglutide 1.2 or 1.8 mg than with glimepiride alone. It should be noted, however, that patients treated with liraglutide 1.2 or 1.8 mg achieved a lower HbA<sub>1c</sub> than those receiving glimepiride monotherapy. At lower HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels, sulphonylureas are known to elicit hypoglycaemia more readily than at higher levels. In clinical practice it may be possible to reduce the dose of sulphonylurea (when used with liraglutide) to minimize risk of hypoglycaemia and maintain HbA<sub>1c</sub>improvements.</p><p>Although weight effects were modest, liraglutide produced more favourable weight effects compared with rosiglitazone, which produced substantial weight gain. In other studies with liraglutide, subjects adding a 1.8-mg dose to metformin lost 2.8 kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>], while those adding both metformin and glimepiride lost 1.8 kg compared with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>] (both over 26 weeks) and those on liraglutide monotherapy (1.8 mg) lost 2.45 kg over 52 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>]. In our study, because sulphonylureas usually cause weight gain, inclusion or optimization of glimepiride but not metformin may have mitigated the weight benefits typically associated with liraglutide. Lack of weight effects could be secondary to lower baseline body weight, withdrawal of previous metformin treatment or defensive snacking to minimize risk of hypoglycaemia.</p><p>It might have been expected that the greater weight gain with rosiglitazone compared with liraglutide 1.8 mg would be associated with a concurrent increase in insulin resistance with rosiglitazone. The absence of this effect could reflect the insulin-sensitizing nature of rosiglitazone. Improvements in pancreatic B-cell function associated with liraglutide are consistent with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>].</p><p>Study strengths include inclusion of both placebo and active (rosiglitazone) comparators and that OGLAs were optimized (not maximized) before randomization to minimize risk of hypoglycaemia. Limitations of the study include short duration of the trial and restriction on glimepiride and rosiglitazone in some countries that precluded maximal dosing.</p><p>The impact of using other GLP-1-based treatments [such as exenatide, or the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, sitagliptin] with sulphonylureas in subjects with T2D has been studied. In a 30-week American trial where exenatide twice a day was added to sulphonylureas, HbA<sub>1c</sub> was reduced by 0.46% from baseline with 5 &#x000b5;g and 0.86% with 10 &#x000b5;g [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>] compared with 1.1% with liraglutide 1.8 or 1.2 mg. This reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> with liraglutide is consistent with other LEAD trials investigating liraglutide as monotherapy or in combination with various OGLA drugs. In these trials, HbA<sub>1c</sub> was reduced by 1&#x02013;1.5%[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>]. Reductions in FPG with exenatide were 0.3 and 0.6 mmol/l from baseline with 5 &#x000b5;g and 10 &#x000b5;g, respectively, compared with 1.4 mmol/l with liraglutide 1.8 mg; weight loss of 1.6 kg occurred with exenatide 10 &#x000b5;g compared with 0.2 kg for liraglutide 1.8 mg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>]. Differences in weight effects may be as a result of lower baseline weight in this trial (82 kg) compared with exenatide (96 kg) and discontinuation of previous metformin therapy, unlike the exenatide trial where exenatide was added to previous sulphonylurea monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>]. Other large-scale trials with liraglutide in combination with sulphonylureas have demonstrated weight loss of 2&#x02013;3 kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>]. Withdrawals from exenatide trials ranged from 24&#x02013;30% compared with 9&#x02013;14% with liraglutide in this study. Nausea with exenatide ranged from 39% with 5 &#x000b5;g to 51% with 10 &#x000b5;g [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>] compared with 10.5% for liraglutide. Furthermore, 41% were positive for anti-exenatide antibodies compared with 9&#x02013;13% with anti-liraglutide antibodies.</p><p>With sitagliptin 100 mg once daily for 24 weeks, HbA<sub>1c</sub> decreased by 0.3% from baseline in subjects receiving glimepiride, with 11% achieving an HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c; 7.0%[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>]. Reductions in FPG and PPG from baseline were 0.05 and 1.4 mmol/l, respectively, while weight increased by 0.8 kg and the prevalence of nausea was &#x0003c; 1%.</p><p>Although head-to-head trials are required to test true differences between these agents, the marked effects of liraglutide on FPG may be as a result of consistent blood levels of liraglutide maintained over 24 h compared with exenatide which has to be administered 60 min before breakfast and dinner and has a half-life of 1.5&#x02013;3.6 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>]. In a recent 26-week head-to-head trial comparing liraglutide with exenatide, liraglutide produced a 0.3% greater decrease on HbA<sub>1c</sub> (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>]. Because DPP-4 inhibitors inhibit the degradation of GLP-1, the efficacy of sitagliptin is dependent on levels of endogenous GLP-1 which is physiologically low compared with the much higher pharmacological levels of liraglutide. Pharmacological levels may be needed to induce satiety, weight loss and possibly larger HbA<sub>1c</sub> reductions.</p><p>Liraglutide is an effective and well-tolerated once-daily human GLP-1 analogue that improves overall glycaemic control and indices of pancreatic B-cell function with minimal weight gain and risk of hypoglycaemia when used in combination with a sulphonylurea for T2D.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The study was funded by Novo Nordisk, the manufacturer of liraglutide.
