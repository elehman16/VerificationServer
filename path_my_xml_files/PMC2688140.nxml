However, this strategy favours further lung collapse or derecruitment, especially when used with a high inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The importance of opening the lung and keeping it open seems increasingly significant in this era of lung-protective ventilatory support because the use of a small V<sub>T </sub>for this strategy may worsen progressive lung collapse. Moreover, the alveolar and systemic inflammatory responses can be attenuated by minimising overinflation and cyclic recruitment&#x02013;derecruitment of the lung by reducing V<sub>T </sub>and increasing PEEP in ARDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The best method of setting optimal PEEP after recruitment to prevent recollapse is still a matter of debate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In the ALVEOLI study, mortality rates and the number of ventilator-free days did not differ significantly between the lower- and higher-PEEP study groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This result may have reflected the use of the same PEEP level (combination of FiO<sub>2 </sub>and PEEP) for the heterogeneous patient group and an inappropriately high PEEP in the nonrecruiters, which may have resulted in overdistension. Gattinoni and colleagues reported that the percentage of potentially recruitable lung tissue may be different in patients with ARDS and that the use of a higher PEEP level in patients with a lower percentage of potentially recruitable lung may be harmful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These studies did not evaluate completely the effect of using individualised PEEP on the survival rate of patients with ARDS. The higher PEEP levels should be adjusted according to individual lung morphology. However, the strategies for setting PEEP using a plateau pressure or recruitment manoeuvre do not decrease mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>We designed an individual PEEP strategy using decremental PEEP titration after an alveolar recruitment manoeuvre (ARM) for each patient with ARDS. An ARM is a way to standardise the history of lung volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether setting the PEEP using decremental PEEP titration after ARM affects the oxygenation and outcome of patients in the early stage of ARDS compared with the table-based combinations of FiO<sub>2 </sub>and PEEP in the ARDS network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Fifty-seven consecutive patients (35 men and 22 women) admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) of Asan Medical Center, in Seoul, Korea, who were diagnosed with ARDS of various aetiologies were enrolled in the study between July 2004 and September 2006. Patient selection for the study was based on the criteria of ARDS proposed by the American&#x02013;European Consensus Conference on ARDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]: acute onset, presence of hypoxaemia (partial arterial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>)/FiO<sub>2 </sub>(PF ratio) &#x02264; 200 mmHg regardless of the PEEP level), bilateral and diffuse opacities seen on frontal chest x-ray and absence of left ventricular failure with pulmonary arterial occluded pressure of 18 mmHg of less.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the institutional board of the ethics committee and written informed consent was obtained from the patients' families.</p></sec><sec><title>Ventilator procedures</title><p>Patients were given ventilatory support primarily in the supine position and ventilated according to the ARDS network strategy. FiO<sub>2</sub>, PEEP and respiratory rate were set to achieve an arterial oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) of between 88 and 92% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The target V<sub>T </sub>was 6 ml/kg of predicted body weight, with allowances of up to 8 ml/kg if the SaO<sub>2 </sub>were below 88% or less than 7.2 of arterial pH by severe hypercapnoea. The patients were randomly assigned with the use of a randomisation scheme to either the decremental PEEP titration group or the control (table-based PEEP setting) group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study groups of patients.

The ventilatory circuit was not disconnected after ARM to avoid lung derecruitment. The ARM was also repeated when the ventilatory circuit was disconnected (incidentally or for bronchoscope) or if FiO<sub>2 </sub>requirement was increasing again in the patient, who showed initial improvement of oxygenation by ARM. If the weaning trial was performed within one week, the ARM was stopped earlier than the usual schedule. During the ARM, all patients were sedated and paralysed by continuous infusion of midazolam-ketamine and vecuronium bromide. No changes were made in the doses of inotropic agents or fluid infusion during the ARM.</p><p>The ARM used the extended sigh method, which is designed to gradually apply and withdraw a high distending pressure over a prolonged period. It takes about 15 to 20 minutes for two cycles of ARM according to our protocol (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We changed the ventilatory mode from pressure-controlled mode to the volume-controlled mode during ARM. The distending pressure was determined by the delivered V<sub>T</sub>, PEEP increment and the pause time (0.5 seconds). During the ARM, PEEP was added from baseline to 15, 20 and 25 cmH<sub>2</sub>O sequentially (every 30 seconds from the baseline PEEP until 25 cmH<sub>2</sub>O). The V<sub>T </sub>was decreased by 25% from the baseline V<sub>T </sub>during the incremental PEEP trial phase, and then returned to baseline levels during the decremental PEEP trial phase. Therefore, the distending pressures were changed depending on the patient's V<sub>T </sub>and lung mechanics. However, we did not allow the peak airway pressure to go above 55 cmH<sub>2</sub>O during the ARM. The decremental PEEP titration at the second cycle of ARM was performed with progressive decreases in PEEP in steps of 1 cmH<sub>2</sub>O every 30 seconds from 20 cmH<sub>2</sub>O while continuously monitoring saturation and static compliance. The decrease in PEEP was continued until a decrease of more than 2% of saturation from the previous SaO<sub>2 </sub>and drop of static compliance was identified. This PEEP level was considered the alveolar collapsing pressure and the optimal PEEP after the ARM was set 2 cmH<sub>2</sub>O above this pressure. No patients showed significant arrhythmia or gross barotraumas of any type during ARM.</p></sec><sec><title>Rescue therapy</title><p>If the level of inspired oxygen was not decreased to 0.6 or oxygenation improvement was not achieved after PEEP readjustment in all patients, rescue therapies such as prone position or nitric oxide inhalation were performed.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures and data collection</title><p>The primary end point was improvement in oxygenation (improvement of PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2 </sub>(PF) ratio). The secondary end points included respiratory mechanics (PEEP and dynamic compliance), ICU stay, duration of sedatives and paralysing agents and patient outcomes (28-day mortality, 60-day mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation). Responders were defined by a 20% improvement in the PF ratio on day 1 compared with day 0 (baseline) after PEEP adjustment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><sec><title>Respiratory mechanics</title><p>Airway pressure and flow were monitored continuously. V<sub>T</sub>, dynamic compliance (in ml/cmH<sub>2</sub>O), and peak airway, mean airway and minute ventilation were recorded at 30 minutes after the change of PEEP level in both groups. Because pressure control mode was the main ventilatory strategy, we monitored and compared the dynamic compliance and peak airway pressure in both group.</p></sec><sec><title>Haemodynamics and gas exchange</title><p>We collected arterial blood samples to measure partial pressure of oxygen (PO<sub>2</sub>), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO<sub>2</sub>), pH, and SaO<sub>2 </sub>30 minutes after reapplication of PEEP.

The incidence of barotrauma was similar in both groups. The durations of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and use of paralysing or sedative agents did not differ between the groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>As suggested by Lachmann more than 10 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], "open up the lung and keep the lung open" appears advantageous to recruit the lungs of patients with ARDS and to prevent subsequent lung derecruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Clinical outcomes were similar regardless of whether lower or higher PEEP levels were used in the ALVEOLI trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The problem of the ALVEOLI trial was the higher PEEP strategy, which was table-based like the one on the current study, matched on the oxygenation target regardless of any patient-related variable. A reasonable approach to determining the appropriate level of PEEP requires maintaining PEEP-induced reopening of atelectatic areas and avoiding PEEP-induced lung overinflation. Higher than traditional PEEP levels together with lung-recruiting maneuvers seems to be a way to find an appropriate PEEP level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Experimental data suggest that the effects of ARM on alveolar recruitment are transient if the preceding PEEP levels are maintained after the manoeuvre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Once the alveoli have been recruited, higher PEEP levels are required to keep them aerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The right level of PEEP as an anti-derecruiting force is important in preserving the effect of the ARM. We previously reported that a sufficient level of PEEP after ARM is important as an anti-decruitment strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>We hypothesised that the decremental PEEP trial would be an appropriate method to establish the PEEP level after ARM at bedside. Because higher PEEP and the ARM performed in patients with mild lung injury may have fewer benefits and more adverse effects, we only focused on ARDS patients to address our assumption. We found that daily decremental PEEP titration after ARM showed only initial oxygenation improvement compared with the table-based PEEP method and did not improve the respiratory mechanics within a week. We performed the ARM and PEEP titration daily during the first week in the decremental PEEP titration group. However, no significant differences were observed in the 28-day mortality, ICU stay and 60-day mortality. Although the responder rate was higher in the decremental PEEP titration group than in the control group, the earlier improvement in oxygenation was not associated with increased survival rate.</p><p>Our finding showed the 60-day mortality in the control group was significantly increased compared with the 28-day mortality. We could not explain whether this finding was associated with the protective effect of ARM to the ventilator-induced lung injury. To add any relevant information, further study will be needed for the biomarkers such as proinflammatory cytokines.</p><p>The lower dynamic compliance in the decremental PEEP titration group was an unexpected result, although there was no significant difference between the two groups. We speculated that a higher peak airway pressure might affect the lower dynamic compliance in the decremental PEEP titration group than the control. A reason for this result might be related to the subjects' characteristics. Most of the patients with ARDS had pneumonia, which did not respond well to the applied PEEP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>We included mostly pulmonary ARDS with severe underlying diseases, which would be a common phenomenon in a university hospital MICU. That may be the reason why mortality related to progressive respiratory failure was higher in our study group. The mortality of patients with pneumonia was 43.3% and the mortality of patients without pneumonia was 29.6%. The baseline lung conditions of these patients was a higher proportion of refractory consolidation to the distending pressure which may also have influenced the PF ratio of less than 250 and PEEP levels less than 15 cmH<sub>2</sub>O after ARM. Talmor and colleagues reported that a low lung distending pressure was applied in the patients with a stiff chest wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We did not measure the chest-wall mechanics or the recruitable lung, so we could not address this possibility as a cause of low PF ratio.</p><p>One limitation of our study is that we could not evaluate whether recruitment manoeuvre maximised the alveolar collapse. If the recruitment effect of our ARM was not sufficient, the effect of a decremental PEEP trial might be insufficient. Borges and colleagues reported that a peak airway pressure of more than 60 cmH<sub>2</sub>O could recruit the collapsed lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Another limitation is that our indicators of oxygen saturation and static compliance to find an appropriate PEEP level might be insensitive to detect the collapsing pressure of the lung. Finally, small sample size in a single centre limits the power of the study outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The daily decremental PEEP titration after ARM did not show the persistent improvement of oxygenation, the respiratory mechanics and the mortality rate of patients with ARDS compared with the table-based PEEP setting.
