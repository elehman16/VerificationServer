Survival rates generally have improved as a consequence of increased detection of early-stage disease and the introduction of more effective therapeutic regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Maintenance of general health and well-being during and after treatment also is essential, and supportive care has become an important component of overall disease management. Anemia is a frequent complication of cancer that results from the disease and/or cytotoxic treatment regimens. If untreated/not managed properly, anemia can lead to physical and functional impairment, with fatigue and exhaustion being the most common symptoms. Results of the 2004 European Cancer Anemia Survey showed that most cancer patients with anemia (hemoglobin concentration &#x0003c;12.0 g/dl), including those with breast cancer, did not receive treatment for their anemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A more recent epidemiologic study (the Anaemia Cancer Treatment study) reviewed data from 2,807 patients with cancer-related anemia (hemoglobin concentration &#x0003c;11 g/dl) in 16 European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Results showed that treatment patterns followed accepted guidelines, and that judicious use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) generally was safe and effective.</p><p>The therapeutic benefit of correcting chemotherapy-induced anemia through the use of epoetin alfa in patients with cancer has been well documented in double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and in nonrandomized, community-based, open-label studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Results from those studies consistently demonstrate that epoetin alfa significantly increases hemoglobin concentrations or hematocrit and decreases the incidence of blood transfusions when treatment is initiated at hemoglobin concentrations up to 11.5 g/dl, and that successful treatment of anemia is correlated with measurable and clinically beneficial increases in energy level and functional status. The current study was undertaken in women with breast cancer receiving myelotoxic chemotherapy who had hemoglobin concentrations &#x02264;12.0 g/dl for the purpose of evaluating the effects of treatment with epoetin alfa on anemia-related patient-reported outcomes (PROs).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>M<sc>aterials and</sc> M<sc>ethods</sc></title><sec><title>Study Population and Design</title><p>This was a phase IIIb, randomized, open-label, multicenter study conducted in six European countries. It consisted of a pretreatment visit, four visits during treatment at week 4&#x02013;6, week &#x0223c;9, week 12, and up to week 28, depending on duration of treatment, and two follow-up visits at 6 and 12 months. The protocol was approved by the independent ethics committee at each center, and the study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Harmonised Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and with the Declaration of Helsinki, South Africa amendment of 1996. All patients gave written informed consent prior to study entry.</p><p>Women aged &#x0003e;18 years with a confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer were included in the study. Patients were mildly anemic (hemoglobin concentration &#x02264;12.0 g/dl) and were receiving myelotoxic chemotherapy for a planned minimum of 12 weeks. The most common chemotherapy agents used were epirubicin, fluorouracil, and cyclophosphamide. Patients also had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) score of 0&#x02013;3, a life expectancy &#x02265;6 months, and adequate renal, hepatic, and hematologic function (not the result of transfusion).</p><p>Exclusion criteria included the following: uncontrolled hypertension; dysfunction of any organ system not attributable to the malignancy or chemotherapy; active second primary malignancy within the last 3 years (other than basal cell carcinoma or cervical cancer in situ); symptomatic or untreated brain metastases; pregnancy or lactation; hypersensitivity to epoetin alfa; anemia caused by factors other than cancer or its therapy; untreated iron, folic acid, or vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency; acute major illness within 7 days of study entry; blood transfusion within 14 days of study entry; major infection within 1 month of study entry; treatment with ESAs within 4 weeks of study entry; and participation in any other anemia-related investigational drug trial within 30 days of randomization.</p><p>Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive epoetin alfa (Eprex&#x000ae;; Ortho Biotech Europe, a division of Janssen-Cilag, Ltd, High Wycombe, U.K.) or best standard care (BSC). Epoetin alfa was initiated at 10,000 IU (5,000 IU if the patient was &#x0003c;45 kg) s.c. three times weekly for 4 weeks. Hemoglobin levels were monitored regularly (up to once weekly) until the increase in hemoglobin was stable, after which hemoglobin was monitored at least monthly until study completion (up to week 28). A gradual increase in hemoglobin concentration of up to 2 g/dl per month was recommended. Dose adjustments were made if the hemoglobin concentration had not increased by &#x0003e;1.0 g/dl above baseline after the first cycle of a 4-week cycle of chemotherapy or the first two cycles of a 3-week cycle of chemotherapy, with the intent to maintain hemoglobin concentrations in the range of 12.5&#x02013;14 g/dl. Epoetin alfa was stopped in cases of a rise in hemoglobin 2 g/dl per month or a hemoglobin concentration &#x0003e;14 g/dl. Patients continued on epoetin alfa until 4 weeks after the end of their last chemotherapy cycle.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of Efficacy and Safety</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in the total anemia subscale from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy&#x02013;Anemia (FACT-An) after 12 weeks of treatment. The FACT-An questionnaire includes 20 items, of which 13 are fatigue-associated items and seven are non&#x02013;fatigue-related items. The Cancer Linear Analog Scale (CLAS) was used subsequently to further assess PROs. The CLAS consists of three linear analog scales that measure energy, ability to do daily activities, and overall quality of life. Each patient was to complete the questionnaires at the pretreatment visit, as well as after 4&#x02013;6 weeks, after &#x0223c;9 weeks, after 12 weeks, and at study completion (up to week 28). The protocol instructed that subjects should be unaware of any hematology results prior to completing the questionnaires. After completion of the FACT-An questionnaire, patients were asked to indicate which item of the questionnaire was of greatest importance to them and therefore that which would be most desirable for the treatment to improve.</p><p>Secondary endpoints included hematologic response; scores on the fatigue and nonfatigue subscales of the FACT-An; scores for CLAS energy, ability to do daily activities, and overall quality of life; ECOG PS score; tumor response to chemotherapy; and 6-month and 12-month overall survival rates. The number of patients transfused since the previous visit was assessed for each group at each visit, and the proportion of patients transfused at least once during the treatment period also was determined. Tumor response was assessed by the investigator at the study completion visit (up to week 28). Survival analyses were performed using all long-term follow-up data.</p><p>Safety was evaluated by monitoring adverse events (AEs), which were recorded regardless of their relationship to study drug and were rated as mild, moderate, or severe. Hematologic and iron parameters and vital signs also were evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The target enrollment was 400 women. The study was powered (with 80% power) to detect a 3.65 difference between epoetin alfa and BSC in terms of the FACT-An total anemia subscale score change from baseline to week 12, assuming a common standard deviation (SD) of 12. However, slow and declining enrollment caused the study to be stopped after 223 patients were enrolled. Assuming two-sided tests of statistical significance and a type I error rate of 5%, the sample size was estimated retrospectively to yield 97% power to detect the specified clinically relevant difference of 7.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] in the FACT-An total anemia subscale score, from baseline to week 12, between the epoetin alfa and BSC treatment groups, assuming an SD of 14.1.</p><p>The safety population was defined as all randomized patients who received chemotherapy, the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population was defined as all randomized patients who received chemotherapy and were treated with at least a single dose of epoetin alfa (for the epoetin alfa group) and had at least a single postbaseline assessment of the primary variable, and the per-protocol (PP) population was defined as all patients from the mITT population with no major protocol violations. The mITT analysis was regarded as the primary analysis. Survival analyses were based on the all-patients-randomized (APR) population.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed with SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), version 8.1. FACT-An scores and laboratory parameters, including hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, reticulocyte count, and transferrin measurement, were compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Changes in hemoglobin concentrations were analyzed using analysis of covariance. Tumor stage was compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test; Pearson's exact test was used to compare metastatic disease, previous surgery, type of chemotherapy, further treatment at follow-up, and blood transfusions during the treatment period. Survival distributions were estimated by Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curves and were compared by log-rank tests. Because the FACT-An data were skewed at the baseline, the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test was used in parallel with a one-way ANOVA. Changes in PROs between baseline and each monthly visit were analyzed.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>R<sc>esults</sc></title><sec><title>Demographic and Baseline Characteristics</title><p>From January 2000 to July 2002, 223 patients were enrolled in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).

In that study, treatment with epoetin alfa (40,000 IU once weekly for at least 12 weeks) maintained or improved hemoglobin concentrations and PROs, whereas decreases in hemoglobin concentrations and declines in PROs were observed in patients who received placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Epoetin alfa was well tolerated in the current study, and almost all the AEs reported appeared to be related to chemotherapy. Although the rates of treatment-emergent venous thrombosis were found to be similar in the two treatment arms, serious thrombovascular events were more frequent in the epoetin alfa group. A higher incidence of thrombovascular events is considered a known and labeled event in cancer patients receiving ESAs. Although our study was neither designed nor powered to detect differences in survival, it is important to note that the survival curves were overlapping at 12 months.</p><p>However, some investigational clinical studies have suggested that ESA therapy might be harmful in certain groups of patients with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. One of these studies was the Breast Cancer Erythropoietin Survival Trial. That large clinical trial enrolled 939 patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving first-line chemotherapy. Those with hemoglobin concentrations &#x02264;13 g/dl were treated with either epoetin alfa or placebo for 12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The study was stopped early because of poorer overall survival in the epoetin alfa arm than in the placebo arm over the 12 months (70% versus 76%; <italic>p</italic> = .01). However, most of the survival difference occurred during the first 4 months (epoetin alfa, 41 deaths; placebo, 16 deaths); the numbers of deaths over the subsequent period were similar (epoetin alfa, 97; placebo, 95). Furthermore, other studies evaluating the effect of ESAs in patients with breast cancer have reported comparable findings on survival and/or tumor progression in ESA-treated patients versus standard of care. In a multicenter phase III trial evaluating the effect of epoetin alfa on anemia and survival, 658 patients with breast cancer receiving a dose-dense epirubicin&#x02013;cyclophosphamide&#x02013;paclitaxel regimen (ETC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] were randomized to receive epoetin alfa (<italic>n</italic> = 333) or no epoetin alfa. Anemia was significantly less prevalent in the ETC&#x02013;epoetin alfa arm (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .0001). At a median follow-up of 62 months, no difference between the ETC-only arm and the ETC&#x02013;epoetin alfa arm was observed in the 5-year disease-free survival rate (71% versus 72%, respectively; <italic>p</italic> = .86) and in the overall survival rate (83% versus 81%, respectively; <italic>p</italic> = .89) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Similar results were observed in two other studies of ESAs in patients with breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A randomized, double-blind, multicenter study (Preoperative Epirubicin-Paclitaxel-Aranesp, PREPARE) evaluated the effects of darbepoetin in combination with chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer (<italic>n</italic> = 773); no difference in tumor response or progression was observed in those who received darbepoetin (<italic>n</italic> = 356) versus those who did not (<italic>n</italic> = 377), although the survival duration was shorter and there were more relapses in the group of patients treated with darbepoetin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A randomized, open-label study evaluated the effects of epoetin beta on overall survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy (Breast Cancer Anemia and the Value of Erythropoietin, BRAVE, <italic>n</italic> = 463) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. At 18 months of follow-up, no significant difference was detected in overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.87&#x02013;1.33) or progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.89&#x02013;1.30) between the epoetin beta group (<italic>n</italic> = 231) and the control group (<italic>n</italic> = 232). However, the authors cautioned that, because of the design of the study, clinically important differences in survival could not be excluded with absolute certainty.</p></sec><sec><title>C<sc>onclusion</sc></title><p>In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that epoetin alfa is generally well tolerated and can protect against anemia and attenuate deteriorations in anemia-related PROs when administered early during the course of chemotherapy to patients with mild to moderate anemia. In particular, this early intervention allows patients to maintain a positive sense of well-being and ability to function, to experience less fatigue during chemotherapy, potentially avoiding the deterioration associated with more severe anemia, and to maintain productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>A<sc>cknowledgments</sc></title><p>Financial support for this study was provided by Johnson &#x00026; Johnson Pharmaceutical Research &#x00026; Development, L.L.C., Raritan, NJ.</p><p>Preliminary data from our study were presented previously at the 27th Congress of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), October 18&#x02013;22, 2002, Nice, France: Pronzato P, Cortesi E, van der Rijt C et al.
