The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy, safety, and the effect on quality of life of once-daily glargine with twice-daily detemir in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on oral glucose-lowering drugs (OGLDs), including metformin. The primary objective was to determine whether glargine was noninferior to detemir regarding the percentage of patients reaching A1C &#x0003c;7% without symptomatic hypoglycemia with plasma glucose (PG) &#x02264;3.1 mmol/l.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>The rationale for dosing detemir twice daily and the study methods we used have been detailed before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In brief, this multinational, open-label trial randomized insulin-naive type 2 diabetic subjects treated for &#x02265;3 months with stable OGLDs (including metformin &#x02265;1 g/day) and with A1C of 7.0&#x02013;10.5%, to 24-week treatment with glargine in the evening or detemir at breakfast and dinner. Glargine doses were increased every 2 days by 2 units until fasting PG reached &#x0003c;5.6 mmol/l, while the systematic titration of detemir involved three steps to obtain both fasting and predinner PG of &#x0003c;5.6 mmol/l (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>The primary outcome was the percentage of patients reaching A1C &#x0003c;7% without symptomatic hypoglycemia confirmed by PG &#x02264;3.1 mmol/l.

More patients on glargine than on detemir completed the study (95.4 and 89.9%, respectively, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001). The main reason for study discontinuation was an adverse event: 7 patients on glargine (1 event possibly related to study drug) and 22 on detemir (20 possibly related) dropped out of the study due to adverse events (<italic>P</italic> = 0.005) (online Fig. A, available in an online appendix at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dc09-2294">http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dc09-2294</ext-link>). Online Table A shows the population's baseline characteristics.

The 8-point PG profiles at baseline and end-of-study show that while the decrease in fasting PG was significantly greater for glargine (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), detemir resulted in significantly larger reductions in PG before and after lunch, before and after dinner, and at bedtime (all <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) (online Fig. B).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>A1C levels (<italic>A</italic>) and daily insulin doses (<italic>B</italic>) during the 24-week treatment period.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zdc0061082540001"/></fig><p>Risk of hypoglycemia was comparable between treatments with &#x0223c;30% of patients experiencing symptomatic hypoglycemia with PG &#x02264;3.1 mmol/l in either group (online Table B).

Quality of life improved during the study with no differences between groups, except for a discrepancy in treatment satisfaction in favor of glargine (online Table C).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This &#x0201c;treat-to-target&#x0201d; comparison between glargine and detemir in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes demonstrated that glargine and detemir result in similar improvements in A1C and similar risk of hypoglycemia. In addition, our study confirms the higher weight gain, lower daily insulin doses, and fewer drop-outs (because of adverse events) for glargine versus detemir, found in the previous comparison of the two basal analogues in this patient group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Finally, our findings suggest that initiating glargine or detemir in patients not achieving adequate control on OGLDs positively affects quality of life.</p><p>Our study indicates that higher detemir doses may be needed to obtain the same level of glycemic control as with other basal insulins. This difference has been attributed to the twice-daily dosing of detemir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), but NPH dosed twice-daily does not lead to dose escalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Moreover, trial data suggest that, although insulin doses are indeed higher in patients using detemir twice- versus once-daily, once-daily detemir doses are still higher than once-daily NPH and glargine doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). At present there is no clear explanation for the increased dose requirements for detemir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>A limitation of our study was its open-label design. This design was necessary, however, as detemir was dosed twice-daily with a separate titration target before dinner. As explained elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), we deliberately chose to dose detemir twice-daily. Trial data available at the time of the current study's design suggested that twice-daily detemir reached superior A1C compared with once-daily dosing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The difference in dosing schedule for the two insulins does, however, affect the interpretation of some of our findings. Advantages of glargine over detemir, such as the greater increase in treatment satisfaction, may be explained by its once-daily dosing and less complex titration. Also, since the design of our study, the current recommendation has become to initiate detemir once-daily (based on a more recent once-daily detemir versus NPH trial showing noninferior A1C reductions for detemir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Thus, with advancing knowledge, it is now clear that another &#x0201c;treat-to-target&#x0201d; trial comparing both basal analogues using an identical, once-daily dosing regimen is desirable.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that in insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes glargine once-daily is noninferior to detemir twice-daily regarding the percentage of patients reaching target A1C without hypoglycemia. Detemir-treated patients had less weight gain and more often achieved A1C &#x0003c;6.5%, but the drop-out rate and daily insulin doses were lower in the glargine group.</p></sec>
