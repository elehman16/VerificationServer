The higher intensity of the motor block of lidocaine was not associated with any harm in terms of obstetric outcome, duration of the second stage of labor, obstetric intervention or neonatal outcome.,As shown in table 4, infant outcome showed no evidence that the type of analgesia had any adverse effects on neonatal Apgar scores.,There was no statistical difference in rates of vacuum-assisted delivery rate.
