milorad,568,5256321,No significant difference,"A combination of several factors, including vestibular, visual, somatosensory, and trunk strength, enables the maintenance of postural balance. Therefore, comprehensive, objective treatment methods are needed. Previous studies have reported on the relationship between gait ability, speed, and independence of performing daily activities from multiple angles. Physicians use various treatment methods and exercises, including trampoline training [2], visual feedback training [3], and sling exercise therapy for trunk muscles [456]. Along with the active development of rehabilitation equipment, physicians use many types of equipment that are already made in Korea in treatments to improve balance, including the iBalance (CyberMedic, Iksan, Korea) and Space Balance 3D (CyberMedic) systems. However, few studies exist on the actual effectiveness of this equipment, and established criteria to evaluate functional improvements are scarce. This study aimed to investigate whether the Spine Balance three-dimensional (3D) system, which was developed to strengthen the deep muscles of the vertebra via stabilization exercise of the lumbar spine, improves postural balance in patients with hemiplegia performing 3D rotational exercises. We expected that this exercise would increase trunk muscle strength and stabilize movement of the vertebra. In addition, this study aimed to study the improvement in gait and ability to carry out daily activities while proving the positive effects of using the Spine Balance 3D system's program and several balance control tests. The results were compared to those obtained with a Biodex Balance System [7], which is widely used for balance training, to prove its effectiveness.", The 10mWT (10-m walking test ) ," Biodex Balance System (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY, USA) ", Spine Balance 3D (CyberMedic) ,0,

""Wound complications were found in 10 of 19 patients after CST and 13 of 18 patients after PR.
Wound complications such as hematoma, seroma, skin necrosis, and infection are reported in 12%â67% of patients after CST2â5,7â12,16 and in 12%â27% after prosthetic repair. Wound complications are associated with the extensive dissection needed in both procedures, which are often performed after intra-abdominal catastrophes. The risk is further increased by the long duration of the operative procedure and the need to mobilize the skin in dividing the epigastric perforating arteries (Figure 4). This endangers the blood supply of the skin, because then it solely depends on the intercostal arteries, which may have been damaged during former operations by introduction of drains, or by stoma construction and other procedures needed in patients with intra-abdominal sepsis.17â19 Wound complications in our series were rather frequent. Although they are mentioned in most other publications about CST, the method of follow-up is mentioned in only one other study from our own group.12Figure 4.
