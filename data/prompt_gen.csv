There was a highly significant correlation between the percentage increase in mass flow towards lobes with a blood vessel density of &gt;9% and the increase in PaO2 (Figure 7). This phenomenon can explain the increase in oxygenation seen in the NIV group as a consequence of improved ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) match. The lowering of the PaCO2 in the NIV group (PaCO2 at baseline 55.4 mmHg, PaCO2 after 6 months of NIV 44.5 mmHg, difference 10.9 mmHg, P = 0.007) can be explained by increased alveolar ventilation by recruitment of the previously occluded peripheral, small airways.",3224655
